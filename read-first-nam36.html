			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="requirements"></a><h4>&nbsp;Requirements and Compatibility</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>The Network Addon Mod will run on any system that meets the minimum system requirements for SimCity 4 Deluxe/Rush Hour.  Most modern PCs should be able to 
				comfortably run the mod.  At least 1.2GB of hard drive space is required, in order to fully unpack the installer, but actual installation size may run from as little as 1.7MB to as much as 850MB, 
				depending on the options chosen.</p> 
				<p><strong>The Network Addon Mod is compatible with the following versions of the game:</strong></p> 
				<ul>
					<li>A) Retail Windows disc copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe OR SimCity 4 with the Rush Hour Expansion Pack, updated to at least Version 1.1.638.</li>
					<li>B) Retail Windows digital copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe OR SimCity 4 with the Rush Hour Expansion Pack (Version 1.1.641), 
					from all digital retailers <em>except Origin</em> (i.e. GOG.com, Steam, Amazon).</li>
					<li>C) Digital Windows copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe obtained redeeming an existing CD key (not purchasing) through Origin Customer Support.</li>
					<li>D) Retail Mac digital copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe, purchased through Steam or the App Store. (NOTE: Platform-specific technical support for the NAM on macOS is <em>extremely limited</em>).</li>
					<li>E) Retail Mac disc copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe, running on macOS/OS X Version 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or earlier. 
					(NOTE: Platform-specific technical support for the NAM on macOS is <em>extremely limited</em>.)</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>The Network Addon Mod is <span class="underline">NOT</span> compatible with the following versions of the game, which will prevent the NAM installer from running to completion:</strong></p> 
				<ul>
					<li>F) Retail disc copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe OR SimCity 4 with the Rush Hour Expansion Pack that have not been patched (Version 1.1.610 or 1.1.613).</li>
					<li>G) Retail Windows digital copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe purchased from Origin.</li>
					<li>H) Retail disc copies of non-Deluxe SimCity 4 (sometimes marketed later as "SimCity 4 Classic"), without the Rush Hour Expansion Pack (Version 1.0.272 or earlier)</li>
					<li>I) Retail Mac disc copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe using the Aspyr Universal Binary Beta Patch, particularly on macOS/OS X Version 10.7 (Lion) or later.</li>
					<li>J) Pirated or cracked copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe OR SimCity 4 with the Rush Hour Expansion Pack.</li>
				</ul>
	
				<p><strong>What should I do if the NAM installer rejects my copy of the game?</strong></p>
	
				<p>In Case F, the solution is simply to install the EP1 Update 1 patch, which can be downloaded from EA (SKU 1-5), SimCity 4 Devotion (SKU 1-5), or Simtropolis (SKU 1 and 2 only).
				To determine the correct SKU version for your copy of SimCity 4, find the installation directory, and look in the subfolder named <em>sku_data</em>.  Alternatively, one can
				simply try all the SKU versions of the patch, until one works.</p> 
	
				<p>For Case G, see the <a href="#origin">section about Origin</a> below.</p>
	
				<p>For Cases H, I, and J, it is recommended that you purchase a digital copy of SimCity 4 Deluxe (NOT from Origin).</p>
		
				<p><strong>What if my disc copy has simply stopped working with Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, or 10?</strong></p>
	
				<p>Microsoft decided in 2015 that secdrv.sys, the driver file used by the SafeDisc and other disc copy protection systems present in many PC games from the early 2000s, was a security threat.  
				As a result, the driver was not included as part of Windows 10, and Microsoft issued a Windows Update, KB3086255, which disables secdrv.sys on Windows Vista, 7, 8, and 8.1.  In the case of the older 
				versions of Windows, secdrv.sys can be re-enabled when needed through the use of the command prompt or a batch file.</p>  
	
				<p>Aside from the advanced step of manually signing a device driver for Windows 10, the only viable courses of action are to either purchase a retail digital copy of the game (NOT from Origin), or to 
				redeem your CD key at no cost via Origin Customer Support (which, unlike purchasing from Origin, will result in you receiving a properly-patched version of SimCity 4 Deluxe).</p>
				
				<p>As noted above, the NAM will NOT install when it detects a cracked executable (i.e. a "No CD" .exe) in the game's installation directory.  The NAM Team does not support piracy, but understands
				the frustration with the game's original DRM system being blocked by Microsoft, forcing one to buy a new digital copy in order to continue playing.  However, the reason why cracked executables are blocked 
				is for more practical reasons, namely the potential for version mismatches (i.e. a Version 1.1.638 crack with Version 1.1.610/613 .DAT files, or vice-versa), which can greatly complicate the 
				team's efforts to provide useful technical support to users.  The <a href="#origin">Origin issues</a> also have played a role in our keeping the version check in place.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="origin"></a><h4>Notice to Users Who Purchased a Digital Copy from Origin</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>Aside from a brief period in 2014-2015, Origin, the digital retail platform run by Electronic Arts (EA), has been selling defective copies of SimCity 4 Deluxe to retail customers.  As of the
				release of NAM 36, this appears to still be the case.  Unlike the retail versions sold by GOG.com, Steam, and Amazon (the "Thin Game Download" version), which come pre-patched to Version 1.1.641, 
				the Origin retail copy is Version 1.1.610.  By virtue of switching out the original SafeDisc copy protection for their own DRM, Origin altered the checksum of the game's executable, 
				which prevents the EP1 Update 1 patcher--a piece of software they made--from running.  This not only prevents the NAM from being installed, but leaves Origin retail copies with all the bugs that the developers 
				fixed in 2003.  It also prevents first-party content creation tools like the Building Architect Tool (BAT) from being installed.  <strong>In effect, the Origin retail copy is unpatched and unpatchable.</strong></p>
				
				<p>The NAM Team recommends you contact Origin Customer Support about obtaining a refund, even after the return period has expired, as users have had success in this case.  If you are among the users
				who are saddled with the unpatched and unpatchable Origin retail version, the team would also appreciate hearing from you, as we have a strong desire to see Origin give their customers a properly-patched
				copy of the game, and are trying to document just how many users are affected.</p>

				<p>Part of the reason for the version check remaining in the NAM is as a leverage tactic to get Origin to do the right thing.  By also blocking cracked executables from installing the NAM, 
				the NAM Team is, in fact, doing Electronic Arts a favor, by discouraging people from pirating one of their games.</p>
				
				<p>Strangely, copies obtained by redeeming an existing CD key at no cost with Origin Customer Support (Case C) <em>are</em> properly patched, despite what the same support team
				routinely tells those who bought copies and received defective Version 1.1.610 digital copies. (There are, however, some recent reports that the CD Key redemption offer has ended.)</p>
				
				<p>For a more detailed assessment of the Origin situation, NAM developer Tarkus has written extensively on the subject at his blog, 
				<a href="https://simtarkus.wordpress.com/category/origin/">SimTarkus</a>.</p>

			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="preparation"></a><h4>Preparing to Install The NAM</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<h5 class="leftheading">Instructions for Windows Users</h4>
				<p>When one initially opens the NAM package after downloading, there will be two items present: <em>read-first-nam36.html</em> and <em>NetworkAddonMod Setup 36.exe</em>.</p> 
				
				<p>NetworkAddonMod Setup 36.exe is the NAM Installer, which you will need to run to install the NAM.  If User Access Control (UAC) is enabled on your system, Windows may ask you to approve
				running the file with a simple "Yes"/"No" prompt.  Click "Yes" to allow the installer to run.</p>
								
				<p><em><strong>NOTE</strong>: Due to some improvements in packaging, the NAM installer is no longer wrapped in a 7-Zip Self-Extracting Archive, simplifying the process considerably from the past few releases.</em></p>											
				
				<h5 class="leftheading">Instructions for Mac Users</h4>
				<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Due to limited team resources and a lack of familiarity with the Mac version of the game among current NAM Team members, Mac-specific tech support is <strong>extremely limited</strong>.
				The best resource for Mac-related inquiries is the <a href="http://community.simtropolis.com/forums/forum/20-sc4-mac-users/">Simtropolis SC4 Mac Users Board</a>.</p>
				
				<p>The NAM installer on the Mac platform is essentially the Windows installer contained within a Wineskin wrapper.  This allows Mac users to have largely the same experience as Windows users in installing the mod,
				though there are some quirks because of this.</p>
				
				<p>When one initially opens the NAM Mac package after downloading, there will be two items present: <em>read-first-nam36.html</em> and <em>NAM36MacWrapper.dmg</em>.</p> 
				
				<ol>
					<li>Double-click the file "NAM 36 Mac Wrapper.dmg".  Once the .dmg file has expanded, double-click <em>NAM36MacWrapper.app</em> to execute the wrapped NAM installer.</li>
					<li>When you navigate through the installation process, the installer will
					show a popup message asking whether you are trying to port the NAM to a
					Mac. Select 'Yes'.</li>
					<li>In custom installation, the installer allows you to change the default
					path of the installation.<br>
					<span class="dec"><strong>DO NOT CHANGE THE DEFAULT PATH.</strong></span><br>
					The default
					installation will end up in
					<strong>"~/Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins/Network Addon Mod"</strong>.
					If that is where your plugins are located, everything is fine. Though, if
					not, you will have to move the folders "Network Addon Mod" and "z___NAM"
					into your actual plugins folder after the installation process finished.
					(Advanced users will want to create a symlink at "~/Documents/SimCity 4".)

					The reason why this is necessary is that, currently, some of the
					installation paths of the NAM cannot be changed which therefore would
					always end up in the default location. Hence, this approach ensures that
					your installation does not miss essential files.<br>

					The location of the plugins folder is <strong>"~/Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins"</strong>
					for the <em>Steam</em> and disk version, whereas it is
					<strong>"~/Library/Containers/com.aspyr.simcity4.appstore/Data/Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins"</strong>
					for the <em>App Store</em> version.<br>

					To reveal the Library folder in your home folder, in Finder, open the
					"Go" menu and hold the Option (Alt) key. The Library folder will then
					appear in that menu.</li>

					<li>During the installation process, the installer will display a popup
					message reporting that it failed to build a custom controller. Ignore
					this. You will get a full-featured controller. The effect of a large
					controller file is not as serious with the Mac rerelease as with the
					original Windows release.<br>

					The reason why the controller compiler fails is that it is Java-based
					and, even if you have Java installed on your system, it cannot interact
					with the wrapped installer, at this point. Advanced users, who want a
					custom controller, may run the stand-alone version of the compiler (see
					point B below).</li>

					<li>After the installation process finished, copy the folders "Network Addon
					Mod" and "z___NAM" into your plugins folder, if it is not in the default
					location, as described in point 4. Also take note of <a href="#datpack">DatPacking</a> situation,
					as it pertains to a bug in the Mac port of the game.</li>

					<li>Enjoy the NAM. :)</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h5 class="leftheading">Additional Notes: Running the Controller Compiler Manually on a Mac (Advanced Users)</h5>
				<p>If you know what you are doing, open the folder <strong>"~/Documents/SimCity 4/NAM Auxiliary Files/Tools/Controller Compiler/"</strong>
				and double-click the file "NAMControllerCompiler.jar". Select the 'input' folder "Network Addon Mod/Controller/" from the current "Controller Compiler" directory, and the 'output' folder
				"~/Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins/Network Addon Mod/" inside your plugins. For the rest, follow the instructions of the compiler.</p>

			</div>
			
			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="upgrading"></a><h4>Upgrading from a Previous Version</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				  <p>If you are upgrading from a previous version of the NAM, <strong>DO NOT UNINSTALL OR REMOVE YOUR PREVIOUS NAM VERSION</strong>.  The NAM installer can detect your previous installation options 
				  by reading the existing folder structure, and as such, it is safe (and <em>highly</em> recommended) to install NAM 36 right over top of your old version.  This feature ensures that your settings from your 
				  previous install will be loaded up by default upon running the NAM 36 installer.  If you remove the previous install, however, you may not remember exactly which options you had selected, and the NAM 
				  Installer will not have a record of your previous installation, which could potentially cause issues in your cities, such as missing items.</p>
				  <p>Generally speaking, the NAM Team makes every effort to ensure that new versions at least retain some form of "legacy support", such that cities built with any previous NAM version will
				  continue to function well with the latest version.</p>
				  <p>If you have consolidated your NAM files using a tool such as SC4DatPacker or JDatPacker, please read <a href="#datpack">here</a>.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="installer"></a><h4>Running The Installer</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
			</div>
					
			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="options"></a><h4>Installer Options</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>The NAM Installer allows for several different types of installation, including a few ready-to-use presets, and of course, custom installation.</p>
				
				<h4 class="leftheading">Installation Presets</h4>
				<p><em>Note: The Installation Presets are planned to be realigned for a future NAM release.  Due to the NAM Installer's abilities to read one's
				existing options and select the same setup automatically in Custom Installation, one will still be able to retain their existing configuration, if desired.</em></p>
								
				<p>In addition to the Custom Installation option, there are three preset options available: (1) Traffic Simulator and Maxis Fixes Only, (2) Networks and Traffic Simulator, and 
				(3) Complete Standard Installation.  The first option is the most minimal NAM installation possible, as it only includes the Traffic Simulator improvements and fixes to base game items, without
				including any of the NAM's other expansions to the transportation networks.  The second option installs everything from the first option, and adds most of the NAM's override network options, but omits
				things such as turn lanes and roundabouts.  The third option includes everything from the second option, but adds in the turn lanes and roundabouts, excluding things such as cosmetic reskins like the Bullet Train Mod (BTM)
				and Maxis Highway Override (MHO), as well as more advanced features like the Level 3 and Level 4 RealHighway (RHW) networks.  A full listing of what each option includes is below.  Note that you can 
				go into Custom Installation, select one of these presets, and use it as a starting point for your installation.  This is particularly useful if you would like to use one of the presets,
				but also hope to install one or two additional features (i.e. Euro textures).</p>
				
				<h4 class="leftheading">Custom Installation Options</h4>
				<p>Custom Installation opens up the entirety of all NAM options to the user, including advanced options.</p>
				
				<!--add information about specific options here later, for NAM 37 Documentation-->
			</div>
			
			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="driveside"></a><h4>A Note About Drive Side (RHD vs. LHD)</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>While the NAM Installer, as noted above, has a series of checkboxes in Custom Installation relating to drive side, it is worth re-iterating that these boxes <strong>only change the compatibility
				files installed with the NAM, and <span class="underline">do NOT change drive side</span></strong>.  If you have an installation with Right-Hand Driving (RHD, vehicles driving on the right side of roads--this concept
				is <strong>NOT</strong> the same as the side one sits on when driving a vehicle) and wish to switch to Left-Hand Driving (LHD, vehicles driving on the left side of roads), this generally needs
				to be done either by adjusting the game's locale files, and then either editing the game's Windows registry entries, or by modifying the game's shortcut.</p>
				<p>The NAM Installer determines the default drive side of your installation by reading the Windows registry flags, and automatically selects the appropriate box accordingly.  
				If you have changed your drive side by modifying the game's shortcut, instead of editing the Windows registry, then this would be the <strong>one and only case when changing the box checked here
				would be needed</strong>.
			</div>
			
			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="4gbpatch"></a><h4>A Note About the "4GB Patch"</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>Due to changes in computer systems, and continued expansions of the NAM's main Controller file, in 2013, it was determined that many newer systems, particularly those with more than 4GB of RAM,
				and running 64-bit versions of Windows, need additional accommodation.  To that end, the NAM includes a "4GB Patch", also known as a "Large Address Aware (LAA) Patch", which allows the game to access the 
				full 4GB of RAM that a 32-bit application can read, instead of the default 2GB.  The NAM's patch was designed by NTCore, and built into the installer with permission, and users with
				systems that need the patch will receive a prompt during NAM installation to install it.  The original patch can be found <a href="http://www.ntcore.com/4gb_patch.php">here</a>.</p>
				<p>The only thing this patch does is to switch the Large Address Aware switch, an accessible switch present in all Windows executables, from "off" to "on" for the game's executable.  Patches like this
				are common in game modding communities, including those associated with Skyrim, Fallout, and Morrowind, and can be used to enhance any 32-bit application's performance on systems with 64-bit operating
				systems and a suitable amount of RAM.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="compilermac"></a><h4>Running the Controller Compiler on a Mac</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>The present version of the Mac installer for the NAM is simply a Wineskin wrapper over the Windows version of the installer.  While this does, in most cases, allow Mac users to have
				an identical installation experience to Windows users, there are some functions of the installer that do not function on a Mac.  One of these is the automatic running of the NAM Controller
				Compiler, which only incorporates the Network Rule (RUL) code needed to handle the options installed.  The failsafe behavior when the Controller Compiler cannot run is to install a full,
				pre-compiled version of the NAM Controller, with all extant code included.  The reason why the controller compiler fails is that it is Java-based application, and, even if you have Java installed on your system, 
				it cannot interact with the wrapped installer at this point.</p>
				<p>If you are an advanced user, and would like to trim down your installation of the NAM on the Mac platform, it is still possible to run the NAM Controller Compiler (a cross-platform application) 
				after installing the NAM. Open the folder <em>"~/Documents/SimCity 4/NAM Auxiliary Files/Tools/Controller Compiler/"</em> and double-click the file <em>"NAMControllerCompiler.jar"</em>. 
				Select the 'input' folder <em>"Network Addon Mod/Controller/"</em> from the current "Controller Compiler" directory, and the 'output' folder <em>"~/Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins/Network Addon Mod/"</em> 
				inside your plugins. For the rest, follow the instructions of the compiler.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="datpack"></a><h4>Regarding "DatPacking" and File Consolidation Post-Installation</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>Programs to consolidate folders worth of SimCity 4 .DAT files, such as SC4DatPacker (Windows) and JDatPacker (cross-platform), are popular options known to improve game performance, given SimCity 4's preference
				to read a smaller number of larger files, instead of a larger number of small files--a fact determined by the BSC Team's "Miramba Experiment" of 2006.  The use of "DatPacking" programs on one's NAM installation, 
				however, is a controversial topic.  The NAM Team's general advice is for <em>Windows</em> users to <span class="dec"><strong>avoid</strong></span> DatPacking (unless one is <em>extremely careful</em>, 
				while for <em>Mac</em> users, the use of JDatPacker is virtually <span class="inc"><strong>required</strong></span>.</p>
				
				<p>In general, if one plans to DatPack one's NAM installation, they should also <strong>save the pre-DatPacked NAM folder in a safe place, outside the Plugins folder beforehand</strong>, then remove 
				the DatPacked version and move in the pre-DatPacked version when upgrading to a new NAM release, or changing options within the same version.  The reason for this is to avoid potential conflicts and issues, 
				such as the "dual icon bug" and Controller file conflicts between new and old installations, as well as to make it such that the NAM Installer can <a href="#upgrading">detect your previous 
				installation settings upon upgrade</a>.</p>
				
				<p>In the case of the Aspyr port for the Mac platform, it possesses a strange quirk in which exceeding a certain number of files or folders (regardless of size) in the Plugins folder can cause game
				slowdowns or even crashing-to-desktop (CTD).  To this end, using JDatPacker after installing the NAM on a Mac is a necessity, in order to ensure proper game performance.  Again, however, one should save
				their pre-DatPacked NAM installation in a safe place, outside the Plugins folder, to make for easy upgrades.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="uninstall"></a><h4>Uninstalling the NAM</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>To uninstall the files, simply bulldoze every NAM item from this download in your cities and delete the files from the Plugins folder afterwards, which will be contained in 
				<em>Plugins\Network Addon Mod</em> and <em>Plugins\z___NAM</em> by default.  Alternatively, one can use the included Uninstaller, <em>uninst.exe</em>, located in <em>Plugins\Network Addon Mod</em> by default, but
				this is actually not recommended.</p>
				<p><strong><span class="dec">Do NOT, under any circumstances, move the uninstaller (uninst.exe) and attempt to run it from another directory other than the default NAM installation directory.  
				It uses a recursive algorithm, which may result in unintended consequences (i.e. deletion of non-NAM files) if run in a different location.</span></strong></p>

			<div class="regtext">
				<p>The NAM is a very expansive mod, with a substantial number of features, which may initially prove overwhelming to those not well-versed in its workings.  The NAM Team anticipates
				that users, particularly those new to the NAM, may want to change the feature set they have installed, as they learn more about the mod's contents and capabilities.</p>
				<p>To that end, we encourage users to keep the installer for the current version handy after initial installation.  If you plan to change your particular set of options, much as with upgrading from an
				earlier version, we strongly recommend that you do <span class="underline">NOT</span> remove or uninstall your existing copy of the NAM. Instead, just load up the NAM Installer and install right over the
				top of your old installation.  The installer can read the contents of your existing installation, giving you an opportunity to see your current set of options in detail, and 
				allowing you to make an informed decision about what you would like to change in your new installation.</p>
