						</ul>
					<p class="title">Version 35 (4 November 2016)</p>
						<ul>
							<li>New RealRailway (RRW) FlexTrack functionality, including draggable Fractional Angle Railroads (FARR) at three angles (FA-2, FA-3, and FA-1.33/1.5) and 
							improved Single-Track Rail (STR) support.</li>
							<li>Vastly improved adjacency stability for ramp-style RealHighway (RHW) FLEX Height Transitions, including many adjacencies with FLEXRamps and Draggable Ramp Interfaces (DRIs).</li>
							<li>Several new draggable NWM transitions: NRD-4-to-ARD-3, NRD-4-to-Avenue, NRD-4-to-TLA-5, NRD-4-to-RD-4, Road-to-RD-4, TLA-3-to-Avenue, TLA-3-to-TLA-5, AVE-2-to-TLA-5, 
							AVE-2-to-Avenue, TLA-7/AVE-6-to-Dual-OWR-3, OWR-4-to-RHW-8S, OWR-5-to-RHW-10S, and OWR-1-to-MIS.  These transitions can either be built through the stub method, 
							or (in case of different base networks), direct connection.</li>
							<li>At-grade intersection support for the Road, OWR, and Avenue Viaducts, plus other stability and cosmetic improvements.</li>
							<li>Multi-Radius Curve (MRC) functionality added to the L1 and L2 RHW-2.</li>
							<li>A number of path fixes involving elevated RHW networks.</li>
							<li>Support for at-grade RHW-4 x Avenue, RHW-3 x Avenue and MIS x Street intersections (OxO only), as well as improvements and additions to RHW-2 and MIS diagonal intersections with 
							Maxis surface networks.</li>
							<li>Proper P57-era RHW support for Moonlinght's Alternate El-Rail and Bullet Train (Shinkansen) mods (OxO only).</li>
							<li>Various fixes to the Maxis Highway Override (MHO), including improved RealRailway (RRW) support, support for moonlinght's Alternate El-Rail and Bullet Train, and Level Bridges for 
							both L0 and L2 MHO networks.</li>
							<li>Re-implementation of some multi-tile RHW and NWM starter pieces, to improve stability in preparation for future additions.  Legacy code has been added to provide stability to older, 
							unconverted starters.</li>
						</ul>
					<p class="title">Version 34 (25 December 2015)</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The Tram-in-Avenue (TiA), Tram-in-Road (TiR), Tram-on-Road (ToR), and Tram-on-Street (ToS) dual networks are now partially draggable.  To activate the dual networks, 
							click the Elevated Rail tool over Avenue for TiA, the Elevated Rail tool over Road for TiR, the Rail tool for ToR, and the Elevated Rail tool on Street for ToS.</li>
							<li>Elevated RealHighway (RHW) networks and draggable Elevated Road, One-Way Road, and Avenue Viaducts can now form overpasses over Tram-in-Avenue, Tram-in-Road, Tram-on-Road, 
							and Tram-on-Street dual networks.  Simply drag the crossing network up to the edge of the Tram Dual-Network to form a stub, and begin dragging from stub on the other side of the 
							Tram Dual-Network to continue the network. Some support for networks besides RHWs and the Road Viaducts has also been added, using similar means.</li>
							<li>RealHighway crossings over Network Widening Mod networks are now vastly more stable.</li>
							<li>Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) for the Road network have been added in draggable form, in four different radii (R1-R4).</li>
							<li>Signalized intersections for One-Way Roads are now possible in the initial phase of the OWR Signalization and Turn Arrow Project (SITAP), complete with turn arrows 
							before the intersection (<b>NOTE: LHD functionality for this feature may still be limited</b>).  These signals cannot automatically appear, due to the game's handling of One-Way Road mechanics, 
							but can be activated by transitioning from One-Way Road to Road just before the intersection.  For intersections between two One-Way Roads, it is necessary to click 
							over the resultant 90-degree Road bend with the One-Way Road tool.  +-intersections and T-intersections between One-Way Roads and Roads, One-Way Roads, Avenues, 
							and +-intersections (no T-intersections) with single-tile Road-based NWM networks (TLA-3, AVE-2, ARD-3, NRD-4) are available.</li>
							<li>7 new bridges by eggman121 have been added, including the first-ever NWM bridges for the RD-4 and RD-6 networks, plus a new RHW-4 bridge, and four RealRailway (RRW) bridges.</li>
							<li>FLEX On-Slope Transitions for the Elevated Road, One-Way Road, and Avenue Viaducts have been improved to support tighter situations, where a 
							network is directly below the elevated end of the transition.</li>
							<li>Many Elevated RHW base network features now show preview textures.</li>
							<li>An issue with High Speed Rail crossings over wider ground-level RHW networks has been addressed.</li>
							<li>An issue preventing the proper override of the ramp interfaces on L1 RHW QuickChanges has been fixed.  Some clickaround may still be necessary to force the overrides to continue.</li>
						</ul>
					<p class="title">Version 33 (26 November 2015)</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Massive update to the Draggable Ramp Interface (DRI) and FLEXRamp systems in the RealHighway (RHW) Mod.  90% of all previous static puzzle piece ramps have been given easier-to-use 
							FLEX and/or draggable counterparts, and a plethora of new ramp interfaces for elevated RHW networks are now available, Wealth textures are included for ground level versions.</li>
							<li>The RHW FLEXFly system has been completely overhauled, and now includes 90-degree and 45-degree versions, in single and dual-lane configurations, at Ground Level (L0), 7.5m (L1), 
							and 15m (L2) heights.</li>
							<li>The double-decker RHW-4 (DDRHW-4) has been lowered one level (from L2/L3 to L1/L2), increasing ease of use.  The DDRHW-4 has also gained support for DRIs and FLEXRamps, 
							including A1 and B1 Outside and Inside Ramps.</li>
							<li>Disconnector added, to simplify demolition of FLEX-based RHW pieces.</li>
							<li>Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs), in both draggable and FLEX form, have been added to the RealHighway Mod, in three different radii, for the RHW-2, MIS, RHW-4, and RHW-6S.</li>
							<li>Stability improvements to the FLEX Height Transitions.</li>
							<li>Major improvements to the RealRailway (RRW) plugin, which now supports most crossings.</li>
							<li>Transit station functionality and compatibility has been further improved.</li>
							<li>Minor fixes to other NAM components.</li>
							<li>New High Speed Rail Project (HSRP) textures, courtesy of <b>vershner</b>.</li>
						</ul>  
				<p class="text_normal"><em>Changes introduced since the NAM 33 Pre-Release of 29 July 2015:</em></p>
						<ul>
							<li>The RealRailway (RRW) FlexTrack system makes an earlier-than-expected debut.  See the FlexTrack User's Guide in the Documentation folder for more details.</li>
							<li>PedMall functionality greatly enhanced with the addition of access paths to most non-Highway-type road networks, including NWM networks and Tram/El-Rail Dual-Networking items.  
							Pedestrians may now directly access the PedMalls from these other networks without the need of a station or other transit-enabled lot/switch.</li>
							<li>Many custom bridges that previously blocked all ferry traffic have now been corrected.</li>
							<li>MandelSoft's previous RHW texture sets, including Euro, Ontario, and Irish/South African textures, have been discontinued.  A new standard Euro RHW set, based on the default US set, 
							has been added as a replacement, and adds compatibility for all current RHW features.</li>
							<li>An issue with the NAM 33 Pre-Release in which the Controller Compiler would fail due to an XML read error has been fixed.</li>
							<li>Several overhanging texture issues with the new RHW ramp interfaces have been corrected.</li>
							<li>The R3 FLEX-Multi Radius Curve now rotates fully as intended.</li>
							<li>A number of Left-Hand Drive transit path file issues across the entire mod have been added or corrected for proper functionality.</li>
						</ul>
					<p class="title">Version 32.1 [Mac-only] (28 June 2014)</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Solved file encoding issues on Additional Bridges, High Monorail, and High Elevated Rail, which prevented the NAM from running
							on Universal Binary versions of the Aspyr Mac port of SimCity 4 Deluxe.</li>
							<li>Introduced an installer to NAM Mac version, using a Wineskin wrapper of the Windows installer.</li>
							<li>Addressed some other transportation-related issues present in the Aspyr Mac port.</li>
						</ul>
					<p class="title">Version 32 (14 January 2014)</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The NAM Elevated Viaducts for Roads, One-Way Roads, and Avenues are now available in a
								draggable form, at both Level 1 (7.5 meter) and Level 2 (15 meter) heights, complete with
								FLEX Height and On-Slope transitions. Overpass situations involving one or more diagonal
							networks are not yet supported.</li>
							<li>Elevated Rail-over-Avenue and Elevated Rail-over-NWM Road-4 dual-networking support has
							been added, complete with a new station supporting both networks.</li>
							<li>The initial phases of the RealRailway (RRW) system have been added. This feature must be
							selected as part of a custom install.</li>
							<li>The RealHighway (RHW) system has been expanded to include the QuickChange
							interchange system, which blends the RHW's modularity with the ease of Maxis Highway
							construction techniques for certain situations, which will be expanded in future NAM releases.
							Additionally, several new types of FLEXRamps are available--please read the instructions in
							the description text. FLEX Transitions have also been given stability improvements for certain
							situations.</li>
							<li>Coupled with the RHW system, the NAM now offers Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) functionality,
							including stations.</li>
							<li>Transit station functionality has been further improved, including the beginning of the
							implementation of the SLURP, which will gradually raise all transit stations to NAM standards.</li>
							<li>The NAM Controller Compiler has been included with the installer, with which it now
							communicates, ensuring that only the installed features are incorporated into the NAM
							Controller, reducing file size and load times. (The e-series and s-series controllers have been
							discontinued.)</li>
							<li>About 50 bugs reported since the start of the NAM 32 Pre-Release have also been squished,
							including some that had been present since earlier versions of the NAM. It is highly
							recommended that users update to the latest NAM in order to enjoy a more stable experience.</li>
							</ul>
					<p class="title">Version 31.2 (4 June 2013)</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Integration of 4GB Patch into installer, further preventing risk of CTDs on newer systems.</li>
							<li>Maxis Highway Custom Interchanges button re-enabled, after fixing HID re-index issue in
							RUL0 file.</li>
							<li>"Sinkhole-to-China" bugs fixed on several RealHighway (RHW) pieces.</li>
							<li>L2 RHW x RHW OxD Stability improved.</li>
							<li>Maxis Highway Override/"Project Symphony" Type A ramp is now able to be fully rotated.</li>
							<li>RHW-10S bridge no longer has issues with missing tiles.</li>
							<li>DDRHW-4 paths now at proper heights.</li>
							<li>Maxis Highway Override/"Project Symphony" no longer causes CTDs when dragged under
							High Speed Rail.</li>
							<li>Further improvements to RealHighway filler pieces.</li>
							<li>Maxis Highway Override/"Project Symphony" OxD crossing with Rail Viaducts now facing the
							correct direction on all tiles.</li>
							<li>Multiple "rainbow tile" issues fixed.</li>
							<li>Some files moved from Rail Viaducts to Base Contents, to address issue with "missing tiles"</li>
							reported by users who did not install the viaducts.</li>
							<li>Several LHD path fixes for bridges.</li>
							<li>Under/overpass on starter situations improved for RHW starters.</li>
							<li>While the expanded RealHighway functionality available in the 31.x-series releases is much
							more stable in Version 31.2, issues still exist with the L1 and L2 Diagonal RHW-6C, 8C, 8S,
							and 10S, when crossing over other RealHighways. The overpass may behave as if it is
							prevented, or produce inexplicable results. Due to the complexity of the coding for any sort of
							crosslinking between two override networks (especially when one is multi-tile and diagonal),
							solving this issue is a veritable "needle in the haystack" situation, and will take substantial time
							to correct. *Support will not be provided for issues involving these overpasses.*</li>
							<li>Two multi-purpose transit stations by E-N of BriPizza have been added, serving the orthogonal
							intersections of almost all single-width networks that differ in height by 15m.</li>
							<li>The NAM Ideal Transit Switches (NITS) have been introduced. The NITS provide greatly
							increased efficiency for all combo NAM transit stations (e.g., all stations with subway access
							and at least one other major network), which results in greater network usage.</li>
							<li>Controller updated to version r184.</li>
							<li>Please note that the installer will "seek and destroy" old NAM installations in your Plugins, so
							there is no need to worry about uninstalling/deleting your old NAM.</li>
						</ul>
					<p class="title">Version 31.1 (6 April 2013)</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Controller divided into two different packages to improve stability--the smaller "standard" (or
							"s-series") package, and the larger "extreme" (or "e-series"), to improve stability issues
							present with NAM 31.</li>
							<li>Road Turning Lanes "semi-automatic" functionality has changed implementation, from Rail
							overclick to One-Way Road overclick.</li>
							<li>A number of transit stations have had bugs fixed or performance otherwise enhanced, and
							several optional new stations have been added. For PC users, any stations plopped in your
							cities from NAM 31 will automatically be upgraded when you install NAM 31.1.For Mac users,
							the replacement set of basic Maxis stations had to be modified, along with the Modern El Train
							Station by Brenda Xne. These fixes were necessary due to a bug in the Mac version of SC4.
							If you're a Mac user and you plopped any of these stations from the NAM using version 31,
							you will have to bulldoze them and replop them once you have installed NAM 31.1.</li>
							<li>New Street network functionality: Some new draggable wide-radius curves, and intersections
							along wide-radius curves, are now possible with the Street network.</li>
							Credit for this new feature goes to Swordmaster from the NAM Team.</li>
							<li>RealHighway Filler Pieces have been restored and expanded after previous issues.</li>
							<li>Installing over previous versions: NAM 31.1 may be installed directly over top of any previous
							NAM releases. It is a full release, not a patch or a hotfix. All
							future updates are planned to be in full package form, and there are no plans to issue patches
							or hotfixes in the future. Please also note that the NAM Team only provides
							technical support for the most recent version, which, as of this document, is NAM 31.1. We
							cannot assist users of the original NAM 31 release, or NAM 30 (or earlier).</li>
							<li>Special Thanks: The NAM Team would like to thank the following members of the community,
							who have tested the penultimate build of the NAM 31.1 controller and given their feedback on
							its stability, and/or assisted with other controller-related tests after the NAM 31 release, in an
							effort to nail down the game stability issues: A Nonny Moose, dyoungyn, Joe 90, mgarcia,
							mneonnew, shanghai kid, spot, and txrailcat74.</li>
						</ul>

					<p class="title">Version 31.0 (2 March 2013)</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The NAM has changed to a "monolithic" package. With the exception of the Diagonal Bridge
							Enabler (DBE), all other separate-download NAM plugins have been merged into the main
							package, including the RealHighway Mod (RHW), the Railway Addon Mod (RAM), the
							Network Widening Mod (NWM), the High Speed Rail Project (HSRP), the Street Addon Mod
							(SAM), and the Rural Roads Plugin (RuRP). All NAM-issued bridges have also been
							incorporated into the package. These plugins may all be selected as options in the new and
							improved NAM installer.</li>
							<li>Substantial expansion of the RealHighway (RHW) Mod network options, including the addition
							of the full Multi-Height System, which allows four elevated heights-L1 (7.5m), L2 (15m), L3
							(22.5m), and L4 (30m). All widths of the RHW also now have L1 and L2 elevated
							counterparts, and the RHW-4, RHW-6S, and MIS Ramps have L3 and L4 available.</li>
							<li>The RHW also now includes FLEX Height Transitions (FLEX-HT), FLEX On-Slope Transitions
							(FLEX-OST), FLEX Ramp Interfaces (FLEXRamps), accommodating many of the new
							networks without adding massive numbers of new puzzle pieces.</li>
							<li>Draggable Fractional Angle Roads have been added at two different angles-FA3
							(18.4°/71.6°) and a new angle, FA2 (26.6°/63.4°).</li>
							<li>For the first time ever, the NAM now includes Lots, adding a basic variety of stations for NAM
							override networks that require them, including Ground Light Rail, the Tram/El-Rail Dual
							Networks, and High Speed Rail.</li>
							<li>Starter Pieces have now been converted to include a self-destructing construction lot,
							simplifying construction.</li>
							<li>Hole Diggers and Raisers have also been added in two forms: the conventional Lot-based
							approach, and a new self-destructing variant.</li>
							<li>Maxis Highway Override, AKA Project Symphony, has been added. This plugin converts the
							Maxis Highways from 6 undersized lanes, to 4 RHW-scaled lanes, and better allows the
							network to interface with RHW functionality.</li>
							<li>Wide Radius Curves added to the Monorail network.</li>
							<li>Moonlinght's popular Alternate El-Rail Mod and Bullet Train (Shinkansen) Mod have been
							added as optional skins for the El-Rail and Monorail networks, respectively.</li>
							<li>Two new SAM sets have been added: the Klinker Streets by squidi, and moonlinght's
							Japanese Streets.</li>

						<ul>
						    <li> Due to a recent file format discovery a number of intersections&rsquo; files have been adjusted to address current &amp; possible future issues. Due to these adjustments, any existing items that made use of these adjusted items will be affected &amp; may show as an invisible tile in-game. If this occurs, please bulldoze &amp; rebuild the given intersection &amp;/or section of network to correct the problem.</li>
							<li> The Structure of the NAM Folders &amp; Installation Files has been modified. This has been done to better handle some of the additional plugins that this mod contains. Please see the <a href="2.InstallationInstructionsFile.htm">Installation Instructions</a> regarding installation.</li>

							<li> Most internal files have now been compressed to help reduce the overall file size of the NAM. This should not affect functionality.</li>
							<li> Main NAM.dat surpasses 10,000 files mark.</li>
						</ul>
					<p class="title">Version 17 (17 June 2005)</p>
						<ul>

					<p class="title">Version 16 (8 June 2005)</p>
						<ul>
						    <li> Ground Light Rail (GLR) Mod (Alpha 3) has been merged &amp; included with the NAM. Currently at this time this inclusion only extends to Puzzle Piece related items. Please see the <a href="3.ContentsFile.htm">Contents</a> for more details.</li>
							<li> Avenue Turning Lane (ATL) Mod (beta_04) has been merged &amp; included with the NAM. Left-Hand Version players please see <a href="2.InstallationInstructionsFile.htm">Installation Instructions</a> for additional Plugin(s) required.</li>
							<li> Left Hand Version Rail-Networks Fix: A fix has been made, for players who actively use Left Hand Version of the game, for all of the Rail-Based networks. This fix encompasses Rail, ElevatedRail, MonoRail, &amp; Subway networks &amp; any intersections involving these networks. This fix makes adjustments so that the Trains on these networks operate &amp; run on their proper side for Left-Hand Version players, just like cars do on road based networks. This fix is also UDI compliant (where applicable). This fix is only applicable &amp; only intended for active Left-Hand Version players. This fix subsequently has a bearing on Transit Enabled Lots. Left-Hand Version players please see the <a href="2.InstallationInstructionsFile.htm">Installation Instructions</a> for additional Plugin(s) required. For more details regarding this fix please read the <a href="5.TechnicalNotesFile.htm">Technical Notes</a>.</li>
							<li> Numerous visual improvements made to various existing items ~ of which there is to many to list.</li>
							<li> OneWayRoad Bridges have been adjusted. The models &amp; textures they use are no longer dependent on the games own files, &amp; hence can be changed. Please see the <a href="3.ContentsFile.htm">Contents</a> for more details.</li>
							<li> Monorail over Elevated Highway overpass.</li>
							<li> Double Diagonal Rail x Orthogonal Avenue (this is a normal ground intersection).</li>
							<li> Numerous new Puzzle Pieces added. Any new Puzzle Pieces have been placed in their appropriate menu button. A majority of new Puzzle Piece items have been integrated into their existing appropriate Puzzle Pieces menu position &amp; can be accessed via the Home/End keyboard key. For example; the Diagonal Road Start/End Puzzle Piece is integrated along with the existing Orthogonal Road Start/End Puzzle Piece. Using the Home/End keyboard keys will rotate the item from orthogonal to diagonal to orthogonal etc. The same applies to many other Puzzle Pieces containing a Diagonal component. Please see the <a href="3.ContentsFile.htm">Contents</a> for more details.</li>
							<li> OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces have been overhauled to address Pathing/Automata issues that currently exist with them. Most OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces now contain Directional Enforcing &amp; contain Directional Arrows to assist with their placement &amp; general use. <strong>Please note:</strong> For this reason any existing OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces should be checked, preferably bulldozed &amp; replaced, especially if Pathing issues start to arise. The game should also be given some time to adjust &amp; update because of this. This adjustment will ultimately reduce the Pathing/Automata issues that currently exist with this item &amp; make them function more efficiently. Using either query tools &amp;/or the bulldozing tool &amp; highlighting OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces (one tile at a time only) will show these Directional Arrows, &amp; hence the flow of direction.</li>
							<li> The above paragraph subsequently also applies to OneWayRoad Overpasses.</li>
							<li> The existing 1x1 Avenue Filler Puzzle Piece has been overhauled to address pathing/automata issue that currently exist with the item &amp; now contain Directional Enforcing. <strong>Please note:</strong> For this reason any existing 1x1 Avenue Filler Puzzle Pieces should be checked, preferably bulldozed &amp; replaced, especially if Pathing issues start to arise. The game should also be given some time to adjust &amp; update because of this. This adjustment will ultimately reduce the Pathing/Automata issues that currently exist with this item. Directional Arrows have now also been added to applicable 1x1 Avenue Filler Puzzle Pieces &amp; preview models to assist with their placement &amp; general use. Using either query tools &amp;/or the bulldozing tool &amp; highlighting applicable 1x1 Avenue Filler Puzzle Pieces (one tile at a time only) will show these Directional Arrows, &amp; hence the flow of direction.</li>
							<li> Various other file item adjustments, improvements &amp;/or fixes ~ of which there is to many to list.</li>
							<li> Main NAM.dat surpasses 8,000 files.</li>
						</ul>

							<li> Orthogonal Road transition into Double Diagonal OneWayRoad &ndash; this must be joined using the Road tool, in a similar fashion as the Diagonal Avenue to Orthogonal Road transition above. Be sure when/if connecting this, that the Double Diagonal OneWayRoads&rsquo; flow of traffic matches up with the road it&rsquo;s transitioning into.</li>
							<li> Elevated Highway transition into Double OneWayRoad &ndash; Orthogonal &amp; Diagonal. The Elevated Highway tool must be used to join the two networks, in the same fashion as ElevatedHighway&lt;&gt;Avenue transition; in order to join, the OneWayRoad section of network must be two tiles width.</li>

					<ul>
					    <li> Textures changed for Street to Avenue intersections for better visual look.        </li>
						<li> Made it possible to have double-wide diagonal rail transition into double wide orthogonal rail and vice-versa</li>
						<li> Created a work-around for a bug that prevented one-way roads from intersecting at a road-avenue t-intersection. In order to build this intersection, draw the one-way road last and draw it only to/from the tile next to the road/avenue intersection</li>
						<li> Made street intersections with road/avenue t-intersections easier. Draw the street last and draw it only to/from the tile next to the road/avenue intersection</li>
						<li> Made it possible for a orth 1-way road to intersect with a diag road/ave t-intersection</li>
						<li> Made it possible for a diag 1-way road to intersect with a orth road/ave t-intersection </li>
						<li> Fixed a visual bug that caused traffic to drive on the wrong side of the road on a diag ave-diag ave T-intersection. </li>
						<li> Fixed a bug that prevented U-turns on diagonal avenues that intersected or T-intersected with a diagonal road. </li>
						<li> Fixed a bug that prevented U-turns on orthagonal avenues that intersected with a diagonal avenue. </li>
						<li> Fixed a U-Drive-It bug for a ground rail intersection that previously did not allow you to switch the track while driving a train in U-Drive-It. </li>
						<li> On Avenue intersections between a straight (orthogonal) avenue and a diagonal avenue, Sims coming from the diagonal avenue could not turn left onto the straight avenue. This is fixed. </li>
						<li> The ability to dead end straight (orthogonal) roads or oneways into a diagonal avenue has been added. Thanks to Teirusu for the textures. Enjoy! </li>
						<li> Diagonal T interchanges have improved graphics. </li>
						<li> Sims could not drive straight through the road in a parallel road onramp to a ground highway when driving so the highway is on their right. This is fixed. </li>
						<li> One of the bugs causing cars to jump to different ramps on diagonal T ground highway interchanges was fixed. </li>
						<li> Avenue/oneway transitions now have custom graphics so they look better, textures compliments of Teirusu.</li>
						<li> When entering a ferry terminal in U-Drive it, your mission could fail instead of being redirected back onto the road. This is fixed, thanks to Karybdis. </li>
						<li> When driving over a ground level highway on an avenue overpass with onramps in the left lane, a U-Drive-it mission would fail. This is fixed. </li>
						<li> U turns immediately bordering avenue onramps on an avenue crossing a ground level highway could not be used by people just leaving or about to enter the highway. This is fixed. </li>
						<li> U turns immediately bordering avenue onramps on an avenue crossing an elevated highway could not be used by people just leaving or about to enter the highway. This is fixed. </li>
						<li> Half of the time Sims went underneath a diagonal elevated highway on a road with onramps, they could not turn left on the onramp. This has been fixed in Rush Hour. </li>
						<li> Half of the time Sims exited a diagonal elevated highway onto a diagonal road with offramps, they could not turn left on the road. This has been fixed in Rush Hour. </li>
						<li> Added the ability to end diagonal Oneways in a T-intersection with a perpendicular diagonal avenue. </li>
						<li> When Sims approached a diagonal avenue from a diagonal oneway, they could not turn left on the avenue. This is fixed. </li>
						<li> When Sims were driving on a diagonal avenue, they could not make a U-turn at half of the intersections with a perpendicular oneway road. This is fixed. </li>
						<li> Added the ability to end diagonal roads in a T-intersection with a perpendicular diagonal avenue. </li>
						<li> Fixed another avenue/oneway transition bug. It should be out of beta now, and fully operational with no further issues.</li>
						<li> Fixed avenue/oneway transitions so that U-Drive-it works in both lanes.</li>
						<li> Transitioning avenues to one way roads without an intersection. </li>
						<li> Previously, cars could not make some left turns onto a diagonal road when approaching from a straight one way road. This is now fixed. </li>
						<li> In three way monorail junctions, you could not change the switch's direction. Driving the monorail over the switch would end your U-Drive-It mission instantly. This has been fixed. </li>
						<li> 3 Bugs fixed which prohibited cars from turning in various directions when a diagonal road crossed a straight avenue. </li>
						<li> Avenues dead ending into streets were completely impassable by any form of transit. </li>
						<li> Perpendicular road to one way intersections oriented on the diagonal did not allow left turns from the one way. </li>
						<li> The rest of the perpendicular road to road intersections oriented on the diagonal were fixed. Sims could not turn left from one of the roads coming from either direction. </li>
						<li> Updated some intersections between avenues and one way roads to show better automata. </li>
						<li> Diagonal Avenues with grid aligned (non-diagonal) ground train tracks crossing the avenue would not allow any cars to pass. </li>
						<li> A road to road diagonal T intersection was not allowing Sims to turn left onto one of the roads. </li>
						<li> Continuing an avenue with one way streets from an avenue/one way intersection did not allow any cars to pass through the avenue/one way intersection. </li>
						<li> Sims could not turn left at some diagonal avenues when approaching from a diagonal road. </li>
						<li> Elevated rail lines crossing ground highways prevented cars from travelling on the ground highway below. </li>
						<li> North or Southbound one way roads could not create T intersections with Westward avenues. </li>
						<li> Some intersections between avenues and one way roads did not allow correct turns. </li>
						<li> Avenues dead ending into one way roads did not allow any Sims to pass through the intersection. </li>
						<li> On half of the perpendicular road to road intersections oriented on the diagonal, Sims could not turn left from one of the roads coming from either direction.</li>
