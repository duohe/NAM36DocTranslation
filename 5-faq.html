						<li class="faq">What's with all the acronyms?  Is there a list of what they all mean?</li>
							<p>Acronyms are omnipresent in the SC4 content world, and they serve a valuable purpose as shorthand.  They can seem a bit arcane at first, however.
							The <a href="5-glossary.html">Glossary</a> in this documentation contains all the pertinent NAM-related ones you may encounter.</p>
						<li class="faq">Why are none of the icons showing up after I've installed the NAM?</li>
							<p>You may not have installed the NAM correctly.  See the <a href="1-instructions.html">Installation Instructions</a> page.</p>
						<li class="faq">Why am I seeing duplicate icons?</li>
							<p>You may have two copies of a given plugin installed.  You'll need to find and remove the duplicate, which could be from an earlier NAM or NAM
							component plugin release, which could interfere with your NAM installation in other ways.</p>
						<li class="faq">Why am I getting a red arrow/gray cursor when I click one of the new icons in game?</li>
							<p>In most situations, this is an indication that you have the Controller file from an outdated NAM release, or an incompatible RUL-bound
							transit mod installed.  You'll need to remove the offending files.  The one exception is with the little icon with the NAM logo at the bottom
							of the Highways menu--this button is not meant to be pressed, but rather, hovered over to show version information.  If the version information
							here says anything other than "[insert]", that's a definite sign there's an outdated/incompatible file lurking about your Plugins folder.</p>
						<li class="faq">After installing the NAM, why are the tiles leading up to my intersections suddenly orange or red in the Congestion Data View?</li>
							<p>The NAM's traffic simulator plugin, with its default settings, amplifies the effect of the Intersection and Turn Capacity Effect property, affecting
							network tiles that are within a 2-tile radius of an intersection (or transition) to better simulate the effects of queues at intersections (esp. signalized ones).
							If you don't like this effect, you can tweak it using the NAM Traffic Simulator Configuration Tool (TSCT).  Lowering the value of the "Intersection Capacity Effect"
							will diminish the redness of the tiles leading up to your intersections.</p>
						<li class="faq">Why are the cars disappearing in game?</li>
							<p>The "cars" are not really there in the traffic simulation--they're simply a visual effect that merely has a casual correlation to actual traffic data in the game.
							Being visual effects, they can eat up processing power, and in order to keep the game from becoming overloaded, the game's engine puts a finite limit on
							how many vehicular automata can show up at one time.  Over that limit, and they disappear.  Certain plugin options for Automata Simulation can allow 
							more automata to stay on the screen at one time, though keeping the cars on the road all the time is simply an impossibility, due to the way the game is programmed.
							SimCity 4 is a statistics-based simulator, not an agent-based simulator (as SimCity (2013) and Cities: Skylines are).</p>
						<li class="faq">What are the differences between "puzzle pieces", "FLEX pieces", "starter pieces", and TE lots"?</li>
							<p><em>Puzzle pieces</em> are ploppable network items, and are placed through the IntersectionOrdering RUL file (also known as RUL 0x10000000 or RUL-0).  The interchanges
							included in the base game for the Elevated and Ground Highway networks are puzzle pieces.  They are effectively static in their implementation--once they are plopped, they cannot
							be altered without bulldozing.  In effect, they are old dogs that cannot be taught new tricks.</p>
							<p><em>Starter pieces</em> are ploppable network items, usually small in size, which are designed primarily to initiate a network override, allowing any of the game's draggable base networks
							to assume a new appearance and/or new functionality, often to the point of behaving like new networks.  One simply places an instance of the starter piece, and drags the appropriate base network through the 
							starter piece to initiate the override.  The technique used to make them was first developed by <strong>smoncrie</strong> in 2006, and was first used in the implementation of Draggable Ground Light Rail (GLR)
							in the Version 21 release of June 2007.  Examples of starter pieces can be found all throughout the NAM, particularly with the RealHighway (RHW) plugin, the Network Widening Mod (NWM), and the Street Addon Mod (SAM).</p>
							<p><em>FLEX pieces</em> might initially appear to be identical to puzzle pieces, as they are also ploppable items, but unlike garden variety puzzle pieces, they <em>can</em> be taught new tricks, and can
							change to better fit their surroundings, accepting input from starter pieces, or sometimes even acting as combination starter pieces/transitions.  Examples of these include the Diagonal Street Helper Pieces, the Avenue Roundabouts, and many newer components in the RealHighway (RHW) system (almost all of which
							are prefaced by the term "FLEX" in their name).  Because of this, a single FLEX piece can fulfill a range of functions that could otherwise require as many as 50 conventional puzzle pieces.  The game also treats FLEX pieces more akin
							to draggable network items upon their placement in the game.</p>
							<p><em>TE lots</em> (short for <em>transit-enabled lots</em>) are lot-based items, also ploppable, but are not RUL bound, and are primarily intended to allow one's sims to switch transit types (i.e. from being on a train to walking) or add some
							non-transit purpose to a particular stretch of a network.  The most common uses of TE lots are transit stations and toll booths.</p>
							<p>For more details, see here.</p>
						<li class="faq">How do I move between the different puzzle/FLEX/starter pieces, and how do I rotate them?</li>
							<p>The TAB key will move forward through a given set of puzzle pieces under a single icon, and Shift-TAB will move backwards.
							Rotation is accomplished through the Home and End keys.  For MacBook users, it's actually Fn+Home and Fn+End.</p>
						<li class="faq">What is up with the icon with the NAM logo at the bottom of the Highways menu, and why does it do nothing when I click it?</li>
							<p>The NAM logo icon is a diagnostic tool, which, if hovered over, will show you which version of the NAM controller you are currently running.  This
							can be useful in diagnosing issues pertaining to the controller.</p>
						<li class="faq">Why is the game crashing after I place a puzzle piece?</li>
							<p>This is a bug in the game itself, typically triggered by attempting to place conventional puzzle pieces in the vicinity of TE lots.  If, in the process of constructing a puzzle piece,
							the footprint of the puzzle piece overlaps that of the TE lot, even before the puzzle piece is placed, the game generally does not understand the configuration, and will immediately crash.
							This is an issue within the game's executable, and as a result, it was long deemed an unsolvable issue.</p>
							
							<p><em>However</em>, <strong>simmaster07</strong> managed to decode enough of the framework that SimCity 4 uses to load DLL files from other sources, and was able to patch this issue with his <em>SC4Fix.dll</em> file.
							SC4Fix is available at <a href="http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30883-sc4fix-third-party-patches-for-sc4/">Simtropolis</a>.
						<li class="faq">Why isn't it possible to add true new networks, instead of using starter pieces?</li>
							<p>Adding new networks is, at this time, impossible.  The base RHW network was only possible as it used an unused network stub left in the game.  There
							are no more unused network stubs for us to use.  The starter piece paradigm allows us to very closely mimic the effects of adding true
							new networks, however.</p>
						<li class="faq">Why haven't you guys added submenus instead of using TAB loops?</li>
							<p>Adding new submenus is, at this time, impossible.  SC4 mod developers have tried for many years, to no avail.</p>
						<li class="faq">Certain draggable items are not working for me, and I'm following the directions.  Why isn't it working?</li>
							<p>If you're referring to starter pieces, make sure you're dragging the specified default network out the correct end of the piece.
							Trying to "drag" the actual starter piece itself will get you nowhere.  If you're referring to a starter piece-based network extension
							not cooperating with a particular setup you're trying to build, it may be that the setup is not supported.  If you're getting "blank" tiles
							upon drawing the item, this is generally a sign of improper installation and/or conflicting files being present in your Plugins.</p>
						<li class="faq">My RCI demand seems to have changed since I installed the NAM.  What is happening?</li>
							<p>The NAM does not directly affect RCI demand.  It does not modify anything other than transportation-related files.  You may have installed something else
							recently that does modify other parts of the game, however.  Because the NAM is popular and a large-scale mod, many newer players
							who have installed other files at the same time mistakenly presume the NAM is at fault.</p>
						<li class="faq">I'm having difficulty using U-Drive-It (UDI) functionality on certain NAM items.  Is there any way to fix this?</li>
							<p>It depends on the item--Single-Track Rails (STR) and the various Turning Lane Avenue (TLA) options in the Network Widening Mod (NWM) are perhaps the most prone to issues.  
							UDI was a last-minute addition to SimCity 4 Deluxe/Rush Hour, and is known for having a number of quirks.  There really isn't a way to fix them because of these quirks, though the TLA quirks can be mitigated
							by disabling "Snap To Road" and driving manually.</p>
						<li class="faq">I'm from North America.  Why aren't the traffic signals so they're on the far side of the intersection, as they are here?  Can I change this?</li>
							<p>The way the game's default traffic signals work with the stop point system on network path files, the signals have to be on the near-side in order
							to function.  Some of the FLEX Turn Lane (FTL) options and Turn Lane Extension Pieces (TuLEPs) use trick stop points to allow for far-side signals, but there are feasible limits to this technique.  
							Recently, however, there have been advances in signal modding, using true-3D props, which have allowed for offset props to be developed, getting around this issue.  Offset props have 
							not been released as of writing, but may potentially be made available as a third-party addition in the future.</p>
						<li class="faq">I'm from a country where people drive on the left.  Can I switch the side of the traffic signals?</li>
							<p>Yes.  Check out the Signal Replacement Project, developed by NAM Team member MandelSoft.  Please note that MandelSoft is no longer active in the SC4 community, and newer items may not be covered by that mod.
							It is not the NAM Team's responsibility to update independent cosmetic mods.</p>
						<li class="faq">Should I use the SC4 DatPacker or JDatPacker tools to consolidate my NAM installation into a single file?</li>
							<p>With the Mac version, it is effectively required to consolidate the mods files using JDatPacker, due to the "number-of-files limit" issue. With the Windows version, it will speed up load times, but you'll need to ensure you remove the DatPacked files upon installing any NAM updates, or else they will
							interfere with the proper functionality of the update.  Unless you also preserve your pre-DatPacked NAM installation, you will also be unable to use the NAM installer's ability to install the same
							options when updating to a new version.  As such, the NAM Team generally does not recommend that Windows users DatPack their installations.</p>
						<li class="faq">How do I build an interchange with the RealHighway (RHW) system?</li>
							<p>Rather than the pre-fabricated, one-piece interchanges of the game's default highway system, the RealHighway system was designed with
							the concept of modular interchange construction in mind.  More details can be found in the RHW portion of the documentation.  An upcoming release of the NAM will, however,
							change this at long last, as a series of FLEX-based pre-fabricated interchanges for the RHW system is in the works.</p>
						<li class="faq">Why aren't my neighbor connections working on RealHighways and/or wider Roads, Avenues and One-Way Roads?  How do I fix them?</li>
							<p>Most RealHighways (except the RHW-2 and RHW-3 networks) and some multi-tile starter-based items require the use of special "Neighbor Connector Puzzle Pieces" (NCPPs) to function.
							For networks that are "combined", having adjacent two-way traffic, simply drag the network to the edge of the city tile, as you normally would (ignoring the fact that the neighbor 
							connection arrows both face the same direction), and plop the appropriate Neighbor Connection Puzzle Piece over it.  You'll need to do this on both sides of the neighbor connection.
							For one-way/"split" networks, follow the same directions, and if there is a gap between the two directions, you'll need to place underground loop pieces next to the city edge, between
							the two carriageways.</p>
						<li class="faq">Why can't I build diagonal intersections with some of the wider Roads, Avenues and One-Way Roads?</li>
							<p>This functionality is still in the works, and will be added in a future release.</p>
						<li class="faq">When is the next NAM version being released?</li>
							<p>There is no  date or timeline for the next release.  We honestly have no idea.  This project is a very passionate hobby for many NAM Team members, but it is still just that--a hobby, something
							we do in our spare time.  It's also a technically complex undertaking, where things can unexpectedly go wrong in development.  It's simply
							not possible for us to predict when we'll be done with a release, and coming up with arbitrary release dates just leads to extremely buggy releases
							or postponement, disappointing everyone in the process.  The one time we did it (in 2013), it did not go well.  Besides, we like to surprise people.</p>
						<li class="faq">I'm a user from outside the North America--are there Euro road textures to make the roads look more familiar to me?</li>
							<p>Yes, just select one of the Euro texture .</p>
						<li class="faq">I have ideas for new features.  Does the NAM Team take requests?</li>
							<p>Certainly.  That said, being the transportation fiends we are, we probably want a lot of the same stuff you do, and there's a good chance it's either in development or planned.</p>
						<li class="faq">I'd like to contribute to the NAM. How do I do so?</li>
							<p>As far membership on the NAM Team or the NAM Associates testing group goes, we're always on the lookout for folks with the
							right skills on the forums.  If you're looking to add something to the mod, show us a prototype of some sort--we'll help you figure out
							the best way to realize it.  We don't, however, have open sign-ups for development or testing positions.  </p>
						<li class="faq">Are you guys crazy, making this extensive mod for a 14-year-old game?!</li>
							<p>Yes.</p>
