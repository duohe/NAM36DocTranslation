      <p align="justify">Regarding the Traffic Plugins in the NAM, they will work exactly the same as if it were the Maxis dual track rail. Please keep in mind that STR tracks are pathed in both ways, so trains might &quot;collide&quot; when they approach from different directions. However, they will simply go through each other, as they were ghost trains. ;-) For busier rail lines, use the regular dual track rail to avoid this phenomenon.</p>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" class="text_normal"><p align="justify">The STR consists of three types of content: starter pieces, draggable trackage, and ploppable trackage.  Each of these is covered  below.  In creating a STR rail line, you will begin your line by using one of the two starter pieces and then extend it by using the familiar &quot;click and drag&quot; technique employed for laying other SC4 transport networks such as highways and roads.  Finally, you can superdetail the default draggable trackage with ploppable items such as long radius curves and switches.</p>
      <p align="justify"><span class="text_zwischentitel">Starter Puzzle Pieces</span><br>
        <br>
        Starter pieces do just what they are called - they allow you to start laying your STR line.  If you've used the Street Addon Mod (SAM), you are familiar with the concept - you plop the two-tile starter section and then drag the desired network away from one end of it.  The starter pieces: one for orthogonal and one for diagonal trackage, are the first two selections in your STR submenu.  The ortho starter shows up immediately, and the diag starter is just a push of the [TAB] button away.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/STR_Tutorial_01.jpg" width="640" height="400"></p>
      <p align="justify">        You can rotate each piece in one of four different directions (orthogonal: 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees, diagonal: 45, 135, 225, and 315 degrees) by pushing the [Home] key to rotate the piece counterclockwise and the [End] key to rotate it clockwise.  By doing this, you have taken your first step toward including STR in your game.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="text_zwischentitel">Draggable Trackage</span></p>
      <p align="justify">You then select the game's track laying tool by selecting the Rail tool from the menu, or pressing the [T] key, click and hold the left mouse button with the cursor positioned on the end of the starter piece that is not &quot;dulled,&quot; and drag STR track in the direction determined by the orientation of the starter piece. </p>
      <p align="center">        <img src="images/STR_Tutorial_02.jpg" width="640" height="400"></p>
      <p align="left">        Releasing the left mouse button &quot;lays&quot; the track.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/STR_Tutorial_03.jpg" width="640" height="400"></p>
      <p align="left">You then demolish with the &quot;bulldoze&quot; tool (shortcut: press the [B] key) the dulled starter piece tile.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/STR_Tutorial_04.jpg" width="640" height="400"></p>
      <p align="left">This leaves with with a stretch of STR trackage that you can drag from either end.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/STR_Tutorial_05.jpg" width="640" height="400"></p>
    <p align="justify">Default switches are easy to create, either by click-dragging one STR segment that is at a 45 degree angle to another STR line onto the second line, or by click-dragging from the existing STR line onto the the segment.</p>
    <p align="justify" class="text_zwischentitel">Ploppable Trackage</p>
    <p align="justify">An extensive set of ploppable trackage, also known as puzzle pieces, has been developed and released in STR Set 1 to supplement the default draggable content.  Several of these items are also necessary in order to be able to connect your STR line to your existing dual track lines.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/STR_Tutorial_06.jpg" width="640" height="400"></p>
    <p align="justify" class="text_normal"> Ploppable STR trackage is used just like the FARR - you select the piece you want, position it and plop it. The wide radius curves are about four times as gentle as the default curves, and really add that RL look to your STR lines.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/STR_Tutorial_07.jpg" width="640" height="400"></p>
    <p align="justify">The STR to dual track transitions give you a different way of integrating STR into your existing rail system. Switches have been made so that you can position them by placing them over existing orthogonal trackage. Finally, the filler pieces allow those &quot;hard to convert&quot; spaces to be addressed. </p></td>
