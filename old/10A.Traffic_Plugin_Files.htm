      </p>

      <div align="justify">
      <p class="text_normal">The NAM Unified Traffic
Simulator
(or the NAM Simulator, for short) is a&nbsp;traffic simulator that
is derived from the
original
Maxis traffic simulator, but is also built upon the knowledge gained
from all previous NAM traffic simulators, including work by
the7trumpets, Tropod, jplumbley, mott, and z. It uses the
Simulator Z core; what makes it a unified simulator is that it makes
available to the player all the main features found in all previous
traffic simulators. What makes this possible is the Traffic Simulator
Configuration Tool
(TSCT), which can be used to customize the NAM Simulator in any of
these ways, and
it also allows the ordinary player to safely customize the traffic
simulator in ways that were not possible previously.&nbsp;The TSCT is available as an option in the NAM installer when the option 
"I want to build a custom simulator" is chosen; it is also available as 
part of the <a href="http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=2379">NAM
Traffic Subsystem</a>.</p>

      <p class="text_normal">Since the NAM Simulator
evolved
from Simulator
Z, many of the features listed here for the NAM Simulator were also
present
in various versions of Simulator Z. However, many of these
versions were never released together with the NAM, and so most people
will be seeing the features they contained for the first time here.</p>

      <p class="text_normal">One of the main areas of the
work on the NAM Simulator involved increasing the efficiency of the
pathfinder to close
to its theoretical maximum. One of the main ways this was
accomplished was by using a much more accurate version of the "perfect
pathfinding" heuristic than had been available in previous traffic
simulators. Also, the Sims' maximum commute time was
increased to
be closer to real-world conditions. These changes allow a smoother
distribution
of traffic throughout the city, with typically less congestion. At the
same time, the congestion that does exist no longer leads to
abandonment due to commute time; Sims know that they occasionally have
to sit through traffic jams, and are a bit more patient. Better
pathfinding also means that Sims act much smarter about finding jobs
and routes to them; this also results in less abandonment due to
commute time. As in the real world, zones can be farther apart without
causing problems; this is especially helpful when building existing
cities to scale. Finally, running the pathfinder with near-optimum
settings allows the simulator to run up to several times as fast as
previous traffic simulators.<br>

      <br>

The second major area of work on the NAM Simulator involved a more
flexible
distribution of traffic among the various travel types. In combination
with the pathfinder upgrading, this allows buses to be counted toward
traffic and congestion, just like all other vehicles. This is a
significant change from all previous simulators, and it's an important
point to remember when planning your transportation infrastructure.
More flexible distribution of traffic also means that the NAM Simulator
is
much more dynamic about allowing Sims to choose their transportation.
In cities with excellent highways and road capacity, car usage has been
measured at over six times that of previous simulators. Yet for cities
with less extensive road networks and reasonable mass transit, car
usage is actually less than in previous traffic simulators.</p>

      <p class="text_normal">For those who wisw to have a
deeper understanding of the principles behind the traffic simulator, <span id="msg_310570"><a href="http://sc4devotion.com/forums/index.php?topic=10261.0">A
Guide to the Operation of the Traffic Simulator</a></span>&nbsp;is
recommended.<span id="msg_310570"></span><span class="smalltext"></span>&nbsp; </p>

      <p class="text_zwischentitel">Other changes in the
NAM Simulator from previous traffic simulators include the following:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="text_normal">More realistic subway
costs. Subways
in Sim City are tremendously underpriced compared to the real world.
The improvements to the pathfinder have made huge networks of subways
less necessary, so the monthly cost for subway tiles has been
multiplied by six to add a little more realism.</li>

        <li class="text_normal">More realistic air
pollution due to
traffic. Until now, the amount of air pollution emitted by traffic has
been unchanged from the original game, where it was based on cities
that had far less traffic capacity than that used by any of the recent
traffic simulators. To keep the amount of air pollution emitted by
traffic to a more realistic amount, the proportion of traffic air
pollution to actual traffic has been lowered in the NAM Simulator. This
lower
proportion is linked to the Clean Air Act, so it is in effect only when
the Clean Air Act is enabled.</li>

        <li class="text_normal">More accurate numbers for
the Commute
Time Graph. Due to a bug in the game, it is impossible to get accurate
Commute Time Graph numbers for all situations. However, the NAM
Simulator has
adjusted the scaling of this graph to provide reasonably accurate
numbers for most situations.</li>

        <li class="text_normal">Improved intersection
effects.
Despite the appearance of stoplights at intersections, Sims don't
actually stop; they don't even slow down unless congestion is present
around the intersection. The NAM Simulator provides much more
congestion
around heavily-traveled intersections, thereby doing a better job of
simulating stop lights and stop signs.</li>

        <li class="text_normal">Greater monorail and high
speed rail usage.
Due to a bug
in the game, monorail and HSR usage is generally less than it should
be,
sometimes by quite a bit. The NAM Simulator compensates for this bug by
raising monorail and HSR usage to appropriate levels.</li>

        <li class="text_normal">Monorails and High Speed
Rail have been fixed to contribute to and be affected by traffic
congestion, just like all other vehicles.</li>

      </ul>

      <p class="text_normal">The following features are new as of the May 2010 NAM:
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li class="text_normal">Greater highway usage.
The
traffic simulator has been tuned so that Sims use highways much more
than ever before. This usage still tends to fall short of
real
world usage, though, due to the structure of the game.&nbsp;The
amount
of rapid transit available in a city will also have a big effect on
highway usage.</li>

        <li class="text_normal">All mass transit speeds
have been recalibrated to provide a more realistic simulation.</li>

        <li class="text_normal">Improved customer levels
for businesses.</li>

        <li class="text_normal">Capacities and speeds of
one-way roads have been raised to duplicate the real-world advantage of
these roads.</li>

        <li class="text_normal">Street capacities have
been raised so that they reflect the capacities implied by their speed
limits.</li>

      </ul>

      <p class="text_normal">There are Park and Ride
versions of the NAM Simulator; these can be enabled with the Traffic
Simulator Configuration
Tool, mentioned above.&nbsp; Park and Ride changes the game
slightly so
that cars cannot reach their destination directly. Instead,
those
Sims who prefer to drive must park near some sort of mass transit
station, and then take mass transit to the stop closest to their
workplace. From here, they must walk the rest of the
way.&nbsp;For this to work well, you need to have an extensive mass
transit
system. You also need to build parking lots and/or parking
garages near key mass transit stops; generally the best places are at
the edges of your residential areas that are closest to your
jobs. Or you could just build parking facilities near the
Sims'
jobs (the ones that come with buildings generally don't count), but
this really defeats the main purpose of Park and Ride. </p>

      <p class="text_zwischentitel">What are the different
versions of the NAM Simulator, and how are they used?</p>

      <p class="text_normal">The NAM Simulator comes in
five capacity versions -
Classic, Low, Medium, High, and Ultra. The name of the version refers
to the network capacities in the simulator. The name
"Classic"
refers to the fact that the capacities are essentially the same as in
the original Maxis traffic simulator.&nbsp;The following is a list
of
the network capacities for each version of the simulator; all
capacities are per tile: </p>

      <p class="text_normal">Which simulator version is
appropriate for
a particular city depends primarily on two things: the population of
the city, and the amount of rapid transit (rails) available. Less
capacity is needed for lower population cities, but less capacity is
also required for cities with a lot of rapid transit. For example, a
city of two million Sims has been run quite successfully using the Low
capacity version of the NAM Simulator, but it had an extremely
extensive
subway system. So pick a simulator version based on these two factors;
if it doesn't seem the right capacity, you can always switch it out for
a different capacity version. Experience has shown that in large
cities, the effects of such a switch may take up to five years to fully
manifest. You can tell when things have stabilized by looking at the
Traffic Volume Graph in the following way: First, let the game run
until there is a sudden shift in traffic patterns. Sometimes, this may
take over a year. Then run the game until you go at least a full year
without any sudden change in traffic patterns. At that point, the
transition to the new capacity simulator is complete. &nbsp;All
this can be done without any harmful effects to your city.</p>
