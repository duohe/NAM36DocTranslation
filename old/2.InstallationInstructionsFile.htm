    <td class="text_normal"><div align="justify"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are able to make use of the <strong>NAM Installer</strong>, it is highly recommended that you do so. The installer can be used instead of having to manually install the NAM.
        <p>Once you have unzipped the downloaded file, there should be several NetworkAddonMod<span class="rot">x</span>.dat file (where <span class="rot">x</span> is a number from 1 to 5), a few &quot;Controller&quot; files and several subfolders. The details of all these files/folders are as follows:</p>
        <p>The files contained in this mod should not have their names changed otherwise some items may not work as intended.</p>
        <p class="text_zwischentitel">5.1 Short method</p>
        <p>The ZIP version of the NAM comes with various files in the root folder and several subfolders with additional files. The files in the root folder are <strong>mandatory</strong> and must be installed. All files that are contained in <em>Additional Bridges</em> and <em>Plugins</em> are <strong>optional</strong> and not required for the proper functionality of the mod. From the <em>Automata Controller</em> folder and the <em>Traffic Controller</em> folder,  you need to pick/use <strong>one</strong> *.dat file from every of those folder. If you have a <strong>left-hand drive version</strong> of the game, make sure to install the file in the <em>Left Hand Version Plugin</em> folder. Finally, pick <strong>one</strong> locale (language) file from the <em>Locale Files</em> folder. Please read below for detailed information regarding these files.</p>
        <p class="text_zwischentitel">5.2 Long method</p>
        <p class="text_zwischentitel">NAM Core Files </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>NetworkAddonMod1.dat</em></li>
          <li><em> NetworkAddonMod2.dat</em></li>
          <li><em>NetworkAddonMod3.dat</em></li>
          <li><em>NetworkAddonMod4.dat</em></li>
          <li><em>NetworkAddonMod5.dat</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The above mentioned files are the main mod files that contains most of the contents. You <strong>must</strong> install these files. The former NetworkAddonMod.dat has been broken into these files to make updates easier. These files will be referenced as <em>NAM Resource</em> files.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>NetworkAddonMod_Props.dat</em></li>
          <li><em>NetworkAddonMod_UI.dat</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The above files contain several props and UIs that are used in the NAM. They have been separated from the core files for easier updates.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>NetworkAddonMod_OverpassUpdate_Maxis_Components_Plugin.dat</em></li>
          <li><em>SFBT_Rail Textures Mod_Darker Textures.dat</em></li>
          <li><em>zzz_Dual_Rail_Texture_Maxis_Upgrade.dat</em></li>
          <li><em>zzz_Dual_Rail_Texture_NAM_Upgrade.dat</em></li>
          <li><em>zzz_Dual_Rail_Texture_STR_Upgrade.dat</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first of the above files contains modified Maxis overpasses that correct the color shift of the underlying networks. All NAM overpasses have been adjusted in the same way. All other files contain modified Rail textures that eliminate the color shift between Maxis and custom Rail textures for the zoom levels 1 to 4.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>NetworkAddonMod_Bridges_Plugin_Controller.dat</em></li>
          <li><em> NetworkAddonMod_Controller_RIGHT_HAND_DRIVE.dat</em> or <em>NetworkAddonMod_Controller_LEFT_HAND_DRIVE.dat</em></li>
          <li><em>NetworkAddonMod_IndividualNetworkRULs.dat</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Without the files listed above, the NAM won't be functional. They have been separated from the contents files in order to make updates easier. If you download any new item that is intended for the NAM, such as additional bridges, the RHW (Rural Highway mod), the SAM (Street Addon Mod), the RAM (Rail Addon mod)/STR (Single Track Rail) or other NAM plugins, you <strong>must update</strong> these files. They will be available as <em>NAM Essentials</em> download.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>NetworkAddonMod_Locale_english.dat</em></li>
          <li><em>NetworkAddonMod_Locale_deutsch.dat</em></li>
          <li><em>(NetworkAddonMod_Locale_[language].dat)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The text strings for the NAM items have been separated from the resource files in order to make translations easier. If you want to create other language files, please go ahead and do so. If you submit your file to the NAM Team, it will be included in the next version. Please install the version that is matching your game language. If in doubt, install the English locale file.</p>
        <p>While the following two plugin files can be used as is without the above files, if you do have the  NAM installed you will need to use one of each of the following: </p>
        <p>Read/Click <a href="10A.Traffic_Plugin_Files.htm">here</a> to see which &ldquo;<em>&hellip;_Traffic_Plugin_...</em>&rdquo; file you should use.</p>
        <p>Read/Click <a href="10B.Automata_Plugin_Files.htm">here</a> to see which &ldquo;<em>&hellip;_Automata_Plugin_..</em>.&rdquo; file you should use.</p>
        <p>If you have a previous version of a &ldquo;<em>&hellip;_Traffic_Plugin_...</em>&rdquo; file &amp;/or &ldquo;<em>&hellip;_Automata_Plugin_...</em>&rdquo; file, it does not have to be removed, you can continue to use it [this will always be the case unless notified otherwise].</p>
        <p>Read/Click <a href="10C.Data_View_Files.html">here</a> to see which &quot;..._Volume_Data_View_...&quot; file you should use.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>NetworkAddonMod_LEFT_HAND_VERSIONS_ONLY_Required_Additional_Plugin.dat</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This file is necessary only for active Left-Hand Versions only, such as UK versions for example. Only use this file if your game is a Left-Hand Version, or Left-Hand Drive Version, &amp; it is actively in Left-Hand Drive mode (i. e. Cars drive on the Left-Hand side of the Road). If you play the game in Left-Hand Drive Mode, this file should be installed as it forms part of &amp; provides additional functional &amp; enhancements for various items contained as part of the NetworkAddon Mod. For technical reasons this file exists as an extra *.dat plugin file. If your game is not Left Hand Version, do not use this additional plugin otherwise problems may arise &amp; some items may not work as intended. Please make sure that this file is located in a subfolder that is loaded last. This can be achieved by adding a &quot;z&quot; to the beginning of the folder name, such as <em>z_Left Hand Plugin</em>.</p>
        <p class="text_zwischentitel">Optional Plugin Files</p>
        <p>While the following files form part of the NAM,  these files have been separate from the  NAM core files, so they can be selected individually. <strong>Note:</strong> If you have used some of the features that are contained in these files, please make sure to install them again. All plugins should be placed in a <em>Plugins</em> subfolder of the NAM installation folder.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>NetworkAddonMod_Additional_Bridges_Plugin.dat</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This file allows users to build new styles of bridges. You will find them in the dialog box opened when dragging a network over water. All bridges make use of in-game models and don't require external dependencies. Various other bridges can be downloaded separately. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>NetworkAddonMod_Custom_Highway_Menu_Plugin_Optional.dat</em></li>
          <li><em>NetworkAddonMod_Custom_Misc_Transport_Menu_Plugin_Optional.dat</em></li>
          <li><em>NetworkAddonMod_Custom_Rail_Menu_Plugin_Optional.dat</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The file <em>NetworkAddonMod_Custom_Highway_Menu_Plugin_Optional.dat</em> removes 4 of the games original Highway Menu buttons, while still maintaining the ability to use anything &amp; everything that was attached with these 4 removed menu buttons by using the remaining highway menu buttons. This file [also] modifies 4 of the other (remaining) games original Highway Menus buttons; &amp; anything &amp; everything is still accessible via using the TAB button on the keyboard with these modified menu buttons. Feel free to try this file out, as it can be safely removed at any time [while the game is not running of course] if you so wish, without causing any functional/technical problems [this will always be the case unless notified otherwise]. The other two files change the order of some transit network related icons in the Rail and Misc. Transportation menues. This was done in order to provide quicker access to the draggable network tools. </p>

        </ul>
        <p>This file removes all  arrows from straight and diagonal OneWayRoads. However, the arrows remain at intersections, so you're still able to tell the direction of a OneWayRoad. In addition, hovering with the Route Query tool above the OneWayRoad will show the arrows as well. </p>

      For installation purposes be sure to place any relevant Network Addon Mod related files in the exact folder as it is represented in the ZIP file, otherwise some aspects may not work as intended. This will simply require cutting &amp; pasting the necessary file(s) into the same folders.</div>
      <p>Any of the files contained in the NetworkAddon Mod that you use should be placed in:</p>
      <p>&ldquo;<em>&hellip;Programs\SimCity 4\Plugins</em>&rdquo; folder</p>
      <p>-or-</p>
      <p>&ldquo;<em>&hellip;My Documents\SimCity 4\Plugins</em>&rdquo; folder. </p>
      <p>[or in a sub-folder of these].</p>
      <p align="justify">Just make sure if you place any of the particular files in either location, that any of the files are placed in the exact same folder and you keep using that same folder location with each and any updates of this mod. Also be sure not to change the names of any of the files, otherwise some items may not work as intended. This will reduce the chances of problems and/or conflicts.<br>

      Any files not used should not be placed in the Plugins folder, but rather placed elsewhere, otherwise some items may not work as intended.</p>    </td>

    <td class="text_normal"><div align="justify">You will find some of the additional Network items in the games Roads menu, Highways menu, Rails menu, &amp; Miscellaneous menu. For some additional items though you will need to activate them yourself using the different Network tools in order for them to appear &amp;/or be activated. An example of this is the OneWayRoad Bridges; you need to select the OneWayRoad Tool from the Menu and drag the tool across a body of water (or land gauge) before you are able to select which Bridge type you want built. Once you select the OneWayRoad Bridge type from the Selection Screen, the game will then build the bridge along with its cost.

      <p>If there is a particular item and/or feature about this Mod that you do not like, then it is simply asked that you do not use it. The complexity of the games&rsquo; files means that a lot of the items in this mod are only possible if it is all done in the one mod, and as such no custom orders to do something specific will necessarily be done. By all means place a request in the Modding - Transit Networks forum at <a href="http://www.simtropolis.com" target="_blank">Simtropolis</a> or the NAM forum at <a href="http://www.sc4devotion.com" target="_blank">SC4Devotion</a>, and it may be included in a future update if it is possible given time constraints and/or other issues.</p>
