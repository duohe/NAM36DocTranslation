      <p class="text_zwischentitel">Q&amp;A</p>
      <p>The contents of this file aims to answer some of the more common questions and/or problems some users might come across with this mod. It is not intended to replace the <a href="2.InstallationInstructionsFile.htm">Installation Instructions</a> but rather accompany it.</p>
      <p>If at any time you have any technical problems &amp;/or questions regarding the contents &amp;/or features of the mod, it is strongly advised that you look through here before deciding to post on the forum/website.</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>Q:</strong> I am new to all this. Where can I find more information about this mod?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Anything that you may want to know or may need to know about this mod should be contained in the files that came with this mod. The Read Me contains links to most other information regarding this mod. Some of the files have links within them though, to other related items. It is up to <strong>you</strong> to make sure <strong>you</strong> read through the files to find what <strong>you</strong> may need. That is the whole reason why the documentation was made; to make it easier for people to find the information they want or need first without having to look through forums/websites.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I play SimCity 4 in a different language. Are there any localized versions?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> There is currently a French, German, and a Spanish  translation of the NAM. These are individual packages hosted on different SimCity fansites. Look at <a href="http://www.toutsimcity.com" target="_blank">ToutSimCity</a> for the French translation, <a href="http://www.simcityplaza.de" target="_blank">SimCityPlaza</a> for the German translation and on <a href="http://www.capitalsimcity.com" target="_blank">CapitalSimCity</a> for the Spanish translation. If you created another translation, please submit it to the NAM Team, so it can be included in the next version.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I see replicated Menu Icons [or Menu Buttons].</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> This means you have a doubled file in either one of the Plugins folders, that should <strong>not</strong> be there. This is thee <strong>ONLY</strong> reason why replicated menu icons might appear in a menu. So search through both Plugins folders more thoroughly until you find the problem file(s).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I have a red arrow and cannot plop the new puzzle pieces.</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> This means you have an outdated version of the NAM Controller in your plugins folder. Please make sure that you installed the latest version, which is either available in the full NAM download, or in the NAM Essentials. Use the NAM uninstaller and the BSC Cleanitol list or Cleanup functionality in the new cross-platform installer to remove outdated files.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Some puzzle pieces or other network items seem to block the traffic.</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Make sure that you have installed the proper NAM version and NAM Controller. There's a Right Hand Drive (RHD) version of the NAM that is suitable for areas where the cars drive on the right side of the road (i. e. the USA or Germany), and a special Left Hand Drive (LHD) version that is intended for the UK or Japanese versions of SimCity 4.</p>
<p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I have just downloaded the newest version, but nothing works or only some things work &amp; some things do not work.</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> 95% of the time, player issues are a result of users not reading the <a href="2.InstallationInstructionsFile.htm">Installation Instructions</a> properly or not at all. If some thing does not work, it is most likely because of a file conflict with the mod &amp;/or the files have not been installed correctly. So you will need to read the <a href="2.InstallationInstructionsFile.htm">Installation Instructions</a> specifically the section that deals with Compatibility &amp; also What files to use; &amp; then look through the Plugins folder to ensure no other files conflict with this mod &amp; that the files in this mod are installed properly.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I have tried everything, but I still can not get anything to work or only some things work.</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> If you have tried everything, then this means you would have tried, &amp;/or need to try, the following; <strong>temporarily</strong> remove anything and everything from <strong>both</strong> Plugins folders, except for this mod &amp; the games 5 original BackGround.PNG files; then Start the game &amp; Start a <strong>blank</strong> New City and then try out the different items that this mod contains. If this is done properly it <strong>will</strong> ensure that the mod works, at which point progressively place any other files [BATs/Lots/Mods/etc.] back into the Plugins folder, progressively testing the mod [in a Blank city] to make sure it still works. If at any point the mod no longer works, then that means a file conflict has occurred &amp; <strong>you</strong> will need to pin-point exactly what file(s) is causing the problem.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I have an old <em>Transit_BugFix_ExpandedOptions</em> file, and I want to keep it because of its features.</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Remove/delete it from the Plugins folder. Anything &amp; everything in that file [among other things] is included as part of the Network Addon Mod. The BSC Cleanitol file that is included in the NAM download will help you with this task.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I use one of the included Traffic &amp;/or Automata Plugin files in this mod &amp; nothing else if I wanted to?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. The main reason the Traffic &amp; Automata Plugin files have been included is to help towards adding functionality for certain aspects contained as part of the Network Addon Mod (PLEASE NOTE: If you have used the Installer to install the NAM, the NAM core files will be installed by default).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I use this mod &amp; now have problems of some sort with my game.</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> From time to time new additions included in this mod may affect existing items in/with the game. If you experience any pathing, automata &amp;/or any other problems with any of the networks, &amp;/or items contained in this mod, with the game when using this mod; in the first instance recheck your installation of this mod by following the <a href="2.InstallationInstructionsFile.htm">Installation Instructions</a> &amp; make sure you&rsquo;ve read the <a href="4.HistoryFile.htm">History</a> &amp; <a href="5.TechnicalNotesFile.htm">Technical Notes</a> for any other relevant information. If a problem persists, in the next instance properly check, completely bulldoze &amp; then rebuild the problem network tiles/items in question. The game should then be given some time to update as a result. If a problem still continues (even after 12-24 months game time) then this may indicate an issue with item(s) in question, in which case please report the problem with specific details so it can be looked into.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I experience game crashing or my game crashes to the desktop when using this mod.</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> There is a known issue with the game that can cause this if certain conditions exist &amp;/or are triggered. Please read the <a href="5.TechnicalNotesFile.htm">Technical Notes</a> for more details.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I can't place my GLR stations on the draggable GLR anymore.</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> The existing GLR stations have to be modified for the usage of draggable GLR. A patch for most stations will be available separately. It's not necessary to bulldoze stations that are already placed in your cities, though.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I use this mod &amp; now some or all of my Transit Enabled Lots no longer work properly.</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> This mod contains a fix that affects Transit Enabled Lots for Left-Hand Version players. Please read the <a href="4.HistoryFile.htm">History</a> &amp; <a href="5.TechnicalNotesFile.htm">Technical Notes</a> for details regarding this fix.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I use this mod, &amp; now some of my buildings have messed-up textures on them, what gives?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> This is most likely due to a file conflict. The various parts of this mod have been made using a particular &amp; <strong>necessary</strong> ID system for the network items; and the only time anything should or would conflict with this mod is if there is another file that is conflicting with it. This would only be due to a custom Mod/Lot/Bat file, as most of the files in this mod have been made so that they do not have conflicting issues with the games original files.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Help! I've installed the new NAM version, and now some NAM items are missing in my cities!</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Most likely, those items are contained in optional plugins. When installing the NAM, make sure to select the same plugins that you installed with the last version of the NAM. The GLR and double-decker puzzle pieces have been made optional now, and the additional bridges that are using custom models are available as separate plugins that are not longer included in the main NAM download. You'll have to download and install those separately.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I can not get U-Drive-It for Elevated Rail to work.</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Read the <a href="3.ContentsFile.htm">Contents</a> file as it explains how &amp; what is necessary in order to access U-Drive-It for Elevated Rail.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> When is this mod going to be complete &amp;/or come out of development stage?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Maybe when Maxis releases the next version of SimCity? The files associated with this mod make it possible to continue adding certain additional network items for some time still.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the ANT item?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> The ANT [Additional Network Tool] item in the mod is actually an unfinished item that Maxis left in the games files. Technically it is separate from the other networks, with its own capacity and speeds. As of January 2008, the ANT Plugin has been discontinued and fully integrated into the RealHighway Mod (RHW; released separately). Please delete the <EM>NetworkAddonMod_ANT_Plugin_Beta.dat</EM> from your plugins folder. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I have installed additional bridges, but they don't show up when I try to build them in the game. </p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Make sure to download the latest version of the NAM Essentials. Since the additional bridges are optional plugins, the functionality may not be included in the NAM core files.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can we change any of the networks to something else; for example; make them wider?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Anything that involves making a network wider, that requires using up more tiles width-wise, is currently not possible. However this may change in the future.  The RealHighway Mod (RHW; released separately) Network Widening Mod (NWM; released separately) do get around this limitation to an extent by using the existing game networks with network override technology to allow wider networks.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> When are more Interchanges, Overpasses, Ramps, Puzzle Pieces, &amp; other items going to be released?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Any additional items made will be released when those making them are good and ready to release them. It may take weeks, sometimes a lot longer, to make something from beginning to end; and no amount of question asking &amp;/or bothering is going to change this or speed up the process.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> When is the mod going to be updated next?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> When those working on it, are good and ready to. We won't provide any release dates, and besides, we like to surprise people. ;-)</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I still use Traffic Cop?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Please read the <a href="2.InstallationInstructionsFile.htm">Installation Instructions</a> regarding this, as it is covered in detail there.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I use one of the &ldquo;<em>&hellip;Traffic_Plugin</em>&rdquo; files, and my Sims no longer use Mass Transit or they use Mass Transit to much, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Most of the Traffic Plugin files alter the way the game&rsquo;s Traffic Pathfinding behaves. They work for the better so that Sims now commute from Point1 to Point2 more efficiently while still keeping their commuting preferences in mind. So if Sims are no longer using Mass Transit or using Mass Transit to much in a particular city, this means the Sims have found a more efficient way to get from Point1 to Point2. This can have a great deal to do with how a city [&amp; region] has been structured &amp;/or laid out. Essentially, people should [try to] alter the way they design their cities, and try build with the different zones being spaced further apart more.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> When I use this mod, my computer &amp;/or cities run very slow, why?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> The general contents of this mod, especially many of the Traffic Plugin files which increase the accuracy of the games Traffic Pathfinding, may have an impact on the overall general performance of the game. What this does is increase the Resource usage of a computer, which subsequently has a roll-on effect &amp; is why some people may experience a slowdown of their computer &amp;/or cities. The more resources a computer has, namely faster CPU, the less of a problem this will be [typically]. Modern computers should be able to handle the better accuracy without any problems.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> When I build an item contained in this mod, my game &amp;/or computer momentarily freezes &amp;/or locks-up when I <strong>build</strong> the item, what is going on?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> This may potentially indicate a problem with the item being built, missing the necessary file(s) it needs to function properly. If this happens to you when building an item contained in this mod, then please report the problem with specific details so it can be looked into.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do I get asked to build overpasses all of the time, &amp; can I stop it?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> This will only occur if you are using the <em>NetworkAddonMod_AUTOPROMPT_Plugin.dat</em> file. There is no other reason why this would be happening. So if you do not want to be asked to build overpasses all of the time; then simply remove this file from the Plugins folder. This mentioned file is no longer supported though &amp; should not be used. The BSC Cleanitol file  that is included in the NAM download will help you with this task.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there anything I can do to help?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. We are constantly looking for others to help with various items, especially <strong>Texturing/Skinning</strong> newly created models. Currently there is only a hand few of people working on this mod, &amp; those currently involved may not always be [so] involved, so the extra help would be good [&amp; some of us are willing to teach others with some of the aspects involved]. The more help all-round would mean some things may be made quicker. Some people have even helped without asking, going out of their way to make various items for this mod, and have thus earned the right to have their name placed in the <a href="9.CreditsFile.htm">Credits</a>.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> SimCity is just a game, all this just for a game, are you nuts?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely. :P</p>
