        <li> OneWayRoad Bridges have been adjusted. The models &amp; textures they use are no longer dependent on the games own files, &amp; hence can be changed. Please see the <a href="3.ContentsFile.htm">Contents</a> for more details.</li>
        <li> Monorail over Elevated Highway overpass.</li>
        <li> Double Diagonal Rail x Orthogonal Avenue (this is a normal ground intersection).</li>
        <li> Numerous new Puzzle Pieces added. Any new Puzzle Pieces have been placed in their appropriate menu button. A majority of new Puzzle Piece items have been integrated into their existing appropriate Puzzle Pieces menu position &amp; can be accessed via the Home/End keyboard key. For example; the Diagonal Road Start/End Puzzle Piece is integrated along with the existing Orthogonal Road Start/End Puzzle Piece. Using the Home/End keyboard keys will rotate the item from orthogonal to diagonal to orthogonal etc. The same applies to many other Puzzle Pieces containing a Diagonal component. Please see the <a href="3.ContentsFile.htm">Contents</a> for more details.</li>
        <li> OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces have been overhauled to address Pathing/Automata issues that currently exist with them. Most OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces now contain Directional Enforcing &amp; contain Directional Arrows to assist with their placement &amp; general use. <strong>Please note:</strong> For this reason any existing OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces should be checked, preferably bulldozed &amp; replaced, especially if Pathing issues start to arise. The game should also be given some time to adjust &amp; update because of this. This adjustment will ultimately reduce the Pathing/Automata issues that currently exist with this item &amp; make them function more efficiently. Using either query tools &amp;/or the bulldozing tool &amp; highlighting OneWayRoad Puzzle Pieces (one tile at a time only) will show these Directional Arrows, &amp; hence the flow of direction.</li>
        <li> The above paragraph subsequently also applies to OneWayRoad Overpasses.</li>
        <li> The existing 1x1 Avenue Filler Puzzle Piece has been overhauled to address pathing/automata issue that currently exist with the item &amp; now contain Directional Enforcing. <strong>Please note:</strong> For this reason any existing 1x1 Avenue Filler Puzzle Pieces should be checked, preferably bulldozed &amp; replaced, especially if Pathing issues start to arise. The game should also be given some time to adjust &amp; update because of this. This adjustment will ultimately reduce the Pathing/Automata issues that currently exist with this item. Directional Arrows have now also been added to applicable 1x1 Avenue Filler Puzzle Pieces &amp; preview models to assist with their placement &amp; general use. Using either query tools &amp;/or the bulldozing tool &amp; highlighting applicable 1x1 Avenue Filler Puzzle Pieces (one tile at a time only) will show these Directional Arrows, &amp; hence the flow of direction.</li>
        <li> Various other file item adjustments, improvements &amp;/or fixes ~ of which there is to many to list.</li>
        <li> Main NAM.dat surpasses 8,000 files.</li>
      </ul>      <p class="text_zwischentitel">05.03.08 (05.02.15B)</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Orthogonal Elevated Highway over Orthogonal Ground Highway Stack. Note; if you&rsquo;ve used a previous (file) version of this in-game, for best usage be sure to bulldoze the item &amp; re-build it.</li>
        <li> Diagonal Avenue transition into Orthogonal Road. To join, simply drag a straight road into a dead-end diagonal avenue.</li>
        <li> Orthogonal Road transition into Double Diagonal OneWayRoad &ndash; this must be joined using the Road tool, in a similar fashion as the Diagonal Avenue to Orthogonal Road transition above. Be sure when/if connecting this, that the Double Diagonal OneWayRoads&rsquo; flow of traffic matches up with the road it&rsquo;s transitioning into.</li>
        <li> Elevated Highway transition into Double OneWayRoad &ndash; Orthogonal &amp; Diagonal. The Elevated Highway tool must be used to join the two networks, in the same fashion as ElevatedHighway&lt;&gt;Avenue transition; in order to join, the OneWayRoad section of network must be two tiles width.</li>
        <li> Fixed a pathing issue with games original Diagonal Elevated Highway over Orthogonal Elevated Highway overpass, which prevented vehicles from using the whole of one side of the diagonal highway overpass.</li>
        <li> New Orthogonal Elevated Highway (Raised) over Diagonal Elevated Highway (Flat) Overpass. The Orthogonal portion of the Elevated Highway rises over the Diagonal portion of the Elevated Highway. This is in addition to the games original overpass of this type, which has the Diagonal portion rising over the Orthogonal portion. If the conditions are right, this will be built automatically when using the Elevated Highway Tool.</li>
        <li> New Orthogonal Ground Highway (Raised) over Diagonal Ground Highway (Flat) Overpass. The Orthogonal portion of the Ground Highway rises over the Diagonal portion of the Ground Highway. This is in addition to the games original overpass of this type, which has the Diagonal portion rising over the Orthogonal portion. If the conditions are right, this will be built automatically when using the Ground Highway Tool.</li>
        <li> Minor fix of issues resulting from custom content (seems some particular custom related Overpasses have been unable to draw/build &ndash; this should now be fixed though).</li>
        <li> Double Diagonal Rail Merge, as well as new intersections related to this. It should now also be easier to draw/drag Double Diagonal Rail. Please note; that while numerous bugs related to this have been addressed, some may still exist.</li>
        <li> (Single) Orthogonal Rail x Double Diagonal Rail intersection, as well as new intersections related to this. Please note; that while numerous bugs related to the implementation of this have been addressed, some may still exist.</li>
        <li> A number of (other) Rail related (drawing) bugs &amp;/or intersections addressed. Please note; that it may require bulldozing &amp;/or (re-)drawing some sections/intersections of rail network in order for some of these addressed bugs to take effect.</li>
        <li> All existing Road/OneWayRoad/Avenue Overpasses, Puzzle Pieces, Ground &amp; Elevated Highway Ramps Preview Models have been given a facelift.</li>
        <li> Following (diagonal-based) Puzzle Pieces added:

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Please note:</strong> Diagonal-based Puzzle Pieces are more temperamental. Extra care should be taken when interacting with these (placement, bulldozing etc.)</li>
      </ul>      <p class="text_zwischentitel">04.11.29</p>
      <ul>
        <li> All Ped Mall Tiles &amp; Footbridges now contain YIMBY Effects. Specific details of the (YIMBY) Effects are as follows:
          <ul>
            <li> Type of Effect (Magnitude, Radius)</li>
            <li> Landmark Effect (150,7)</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> In addition Ped Mall Tiles now contain an extra &lsquo;Pedestrian Automata&rsquo; Effect. Pedestrian Automata should now spawn on Ped Mall Tiles periodically from time to time in addition to the natural automata of Ped Mall Tiles.</li>
      </ul>      <p class="text_zwischentitel">04.11.15</p>
      <ul>
        <li> ElevatedHighway to GroundHighway <strong>Extended</strong> Transition (This is actually an Interchange item).</li>
        <li> Missing Paths fixed for the Avenue Y-Stack, causing a delayed reaction/freezing with the game when placed.</li>

        <li> Various GroundHighway, ElevatedHighway, &amp; Avenue; intersections &amp;/or tiles; fixes &amp;/or improvements, &amp; are as follows;</li>
        <li> GroundHighways &amp; ElevatedHighways can now be shifted over sidewards by just one tile in a single continuous stretch, thus removing the previous two tile restriction. This is applicable to both Orthogonal &amp; Diagonal directions (try a little experimenting).</li>
        <li> Models, Textures, &amp;/or Paths addressed as applicable for the following items (References to &ldquo;S-Curve&rdquo; can &amp; do encompass a sideward shift of the network mentioned by one tile &amp;/or two tiles, as applicable). <strong>Please note</strong> that some of these may still have some minor issues with them.

      <li> Textures changed for Street to Avenue intersections for better visual look.        </li>
      <li> Made it possible to have double-wide diagonal rail transition into double wide orthogonal rail and vice-versa</li>
      <li> Created a work-around for a bug that prevented one-way roads from intersecting at a road-avenue t-intersection. In order to build this intersection, draw the one-way road last and draw it only to/from the tile next to the road/avenue intersection</li>
      <li> Made street intersections with road/avenue t-intersections easier. Draw the street last and draw it only to/from the tile next to the road/avenue intersection</li>
      <li> Made it possible for a orth 1-way road to intersect with a diag road/ave t-intersection</li>
      <li> Made it possible for a diag 1-way road to intersect with a orth road/ave t-intersection </li>
      <li> Fixed a visual bug that caused traffic to drive on the wrong side of the road on a diag ave-diag ave T-intersection. </li>
      <li> Fixed a bug that prevented U-turns on diagonal avenues that intersected or T-intersected with a diagonal road. </li>
      <li> Fixed a bug that prevented U-turns on orthagonal avenues that intersected with a diagonal avenue. </li>
      <li> Fixed a U-Drive-It bug for a ground rail intersection that previously did not allow you to switch the track while driving a train in U-Drive-It. </li>
      <li> On Avenue intersections between a straight (orthogonal) avenue and a diagonal avenue, Sims coming from the diagonal avenue could not turn left onto the straight avenue. This is fixed. </li>
      <li> The ability to dead end straight (orthogonal) roads or oneways into a diagonal avenue has been added. Thanks to Teirusu for the textures. Enjoy! </li>
      <li> Diagonal T interchanges have improved graphics. </li>
      <li> Sims could not drive straight through the road in a parallel road onramp to a ground highway when driving so the highway is on their right. This is fixed. </li>
      <li> One of the bugs causing cars to jump to different ramps on diagonal T ground highway interchanges was fixed. </li>
      <li> Avenue/oneway transitions now have custom graphics so they look better, textures compliments of Teirusu.</li>
      <li> When entering a ferry terminal in U-Drive it, your mission could fail instead of being redirected back onto the road. This is fixed, thanks to Karybdis. </li>
      <li> When driving over a ground level highway on an avenue overpass with onramps in the left lane, a U-Drive-it mission would fail. This is fixed. </li>
      <li> U turns immediately bordering avenue onramps on an avenue crossing a ground level highway could not be used by people just leaving or about to enter the highway. This is fixed. </li>
      <li> U turns immediately bordering avenue onramps on an avenue crossing an elevated highway could not be used by people just leaving or about to enter the highway. This is fixed. </li>
      <li> Half of the time Sims went underneath a diagonal elevated highway on a road with onramps, they could not turn left on the onramp. This has been fixed in Rush Hour. </li>
      <li> Half of the time Sims exited a diagonal elevated highway onto a diagonal road with offramps, they could not turn left on the road. This has been fixed in Rush Hour. </li>
      <li> Added the ability to end diagonal Oneways in a T-intersection with a perpendicular diagonal avenue. </li>
      <li> When Sims approached a diagonal avenue from a diagonal oneway, they could not turn left on the avenue. This is fixed. </li>
      <li> When Sims were driving on a diagonal avenue, they could not make a U-turn at half of the intersections with a perpendicular oneway road. This is fixed. </li>
      <li> Added the ability to end diagonal roads in a T-intersection with a perpendicular diagonal avenue. </li>
      <li> Fixed another avenue/oneway transition bug. It should be out of beta now, and fully operational with no further issues.</li>
      <li> Fixed avenue/oneway transitions so that U-Drive-it works in both lanes.</li>
      <li> Transitioning avenues to one way roads without an intersection. </li>
      <li> Previously, cars could not make some left turns onto a diagonal road when approaching from a straight one way road. This is now fixed. </li>
      <li> In three way monorail junctions, you could not change the switch's direction. Driving the monorail over the switch would end your U-Drive-It mission instantly. This has been fixed. </li>
      <li> 3 Bugs fixed which prohibited cars from turning in various directions when a diagonal road crossed a straight avenue. </li>
      <li> Avenues dead ending into streets were completely impassable by any form of transit. </li>
      <li> Perpendicular road to one way intersections oriented on the diagonal did not allow left turns from the one way. </li>
      <li> The rest of the perpendicular road to road intersections oriented on the diagonal were fixed. Sims could not turn left from one of the roads coming from either direction. </li>
      <li> Updated some intersections between avenues and one way roads to show better automata. </li>
      <li> Diagonal Avenues with grid aligned (non-diagonal) ground train tracks crossing the avenue would not allow any cars to pass. </li>
      <li> A road to road diagonal T intersection was not allowing Sims to turn left onto one of the roads. </li>
      <li> Continuing an avenue with one way streets from an avenue/one way intersection did not allow any cars to pass through the avenue/one way intersection. </li>
      <li> Sims could not turn left at some diagonal avenues when approaching from a diagonal road. </li>
      <li> Elevated rail lines crossing ground highways prevented cars from travelling on the ground highway below. </li>
      <li> North or Southbound one way roads could not create T intersections with Westward avenues. </li>
      <li> Some intersections between avenues and one way roads did not allow correct turns. </li>
      <li> Avenues dead ending into one way roads did not allow any Sims to pass through the intersection. </li>
      <li> On half of the perpendicular road to road intersections oriented on the diagonal, Sims could not turn left from one of the roads coming from either direction.</li>
