			<div class="regtext">
				<p>The FLEX Turn Lanes (FTLs) are the newest and fullest-featured implementation of turn lanes in the NAM.  There are two ways to construct FLEX Turn Lanes: the "quick" method, 
				using pre-assembled FLEX Piece configurations for various intersection types, and the "standard" method, which utilizes a combination of Starter Pieces and FLEX Pieces for most construction 
				options, combined with Drag Patterns for the construction of Slip Lanes.  The "quick" method is easier for novice users and those looking for the fastest way to build a FLEX Turn Lane setup, 
				while the "standard" method allows for more configuration options, and finer control over one's turn lane setups when compared to the "quick" method.
				</p>
			
				<h4 class="leftheading">Installing FLEX Turn Lanes</h4>
				<p>In order to install the FLEX Turn Lanes, select the "FLEX Turn Lanes (FTL)" checkbox, which is located under <em>Additional Features and Customizations > Turn Lanes</em>, 
				and is visible after clicking the "+" sign to expand the menu.  This plugin does require that the <a href="../../feature-guides/network-widening-mod/network-widening-mod.html">Network Widening Mod (NWM)</a> also
				be installed, as it is required for some features to function properly.
				For more information on installation, see the <a href="../../2-installation.html">Installation Guide</a>.</p>

				<h4 class="leftheading">Type Nomenclature</h4>
				<p>The types of FLEX Turn Lane setups included are defined by a three-digit number.  The first number is the number of <strong>dedicated "inside" turn lanes</strong>--left turn lanes if traffic drives on the right, 
				right turn lanes if traffic drives on the left.  The second number is the number of <strong>"through" lanes</strong> on the base network for the given setup.  The third number denotes the number of <strong>dedicated 
				"outside" turn lanes</strong>--right turn lanes if traffic drives on the right, left turn lanes if traffic drives on the left.  (Presently, there are no setups with a third digit greater than zero; these setups may be added
				in a later release.)</p>
			
				<p>Here is a listing of the types of FLEX Turn lanes currently available in the NAM, and their corresponding base networks:</p>
				<ul class="paddedlist">
					<li><strong>Type 110 (Base: Road)</strong> (Single-Tile/1 Inside Turn Lane, 1 Through Lane, 0 Outside Turn Lanes): Road, NWM 3-Lane Turning Lane Avenue (TLA-3), NWM 2-Lane Avenue (AVE-2), NWM 3-Lane Asymmetrical Road (ARD-3)</li>
					<ul class="paddedlist"><li>Also includes "Median" variant for use on T-intersections</li></ul>
					<li><strong>Type 120 (Base: Avenue or Road)</strong> (Dual-Tile/1 Inside Turn Lane, 2 Through Lanes, 0 Outside Turn Lanes): Avenue, NWM 5-Lane Turning Lane Avenue (TLA-5)</li>
					<li><strong>Type 220 (Base: Avenue or Road)</strong> (Dual-Tile/2 Inside Turn Lane, 2 Through Lanes, 0 Outside Turn Lanes): Avenue, NWM 5-Lane Turning Lane Avenue (TLA-5)</li>
					<li><strong>Type 130 (Base: Road)</strong> (Triple-Tile/1 Inside Turn Lane, 3 Through Lanes, 0 Outside Turn Lanes): NWM 6-Lane Avenue (AVE-6), NWM 7-Lane Turning Lane Avenue (TLA-7)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<span><img class="standimg" src="images/ftl-type110.jpg" alt="Type 110">&nbsp;<img class="standimg" src="images/ftl-type110-median.jpg" alt="Type 110 Median"></span>
				<span><img class="standimg" src="images/ftl-type120.jpg" alt="Type 120">&nbsp;<img class="standimg" src="images/ftl-type220.jpg" alt="Type 220"></span>
				<span><img class="standimg" src="images/ftl-type130.jpg" alt="Type 130">&nbsp;</span>
							
				<p>In addition to these setups, Slip Lanes are also possible to add to not only FLEX Turn Lane setups, but also base Maxis networks and Network Widening Mod (NWM) override networks.</p>
				
				<h4 class="leftheading">Effect on Simulation</h4>
				<p>The Type 110 (non-Median) setups have the same capacity as the NWM's TLA-3, AVE-2, and ARD-3 networks, by virtue of the use of Distilled Intersection Paths (DIPs) to boost per-tile capacity by 25% over that of the base network.</p>
				<p>The Type 120 setups have the same capacity as an Avenue, with the caveat that traffic on the inner turn lane will be displaced from through traffic, thereby raising the capacity of through traffic (though
				potentially impacting traffic leaving the intersection).</p>
				<p>The Type 220 setups have the same capacity as the NWM's TLA-5 and RD-6 networks, by virtue of the use of Distilled Intersection Paths (DIPs) to boost per-tile capacity by 25% over that of the base network.</p>
				<p>The Type 130 setups have the same capacity as the NWM's TLA-7 and AVE-6 networks.</p>
				<p>The Slip Lanes will draw traffic away from the through lanes before the intersection.</p>
			
			
				<h4 class="leftheading">FLEX Turn Lane Content and Menu Navigation</h4>
				<p>The FLEX Turn Lane menu system is divided into two menu buttons: the <strong>QuickTurn</strong> button, used for constructing FLEX Turn Lanes using the quick method, 
				and the <strong>FLEX Turn Lanes</strong> button, used for building FLEX Turn Lanes through the standard method.</p>
			
				<p>The <strong>QuickTurn</strong> button contains the following menu items:</p>
				<ol>
					<li></li>
				</ol>
			
				<!--images of FTL Quick items-->

			
				<p>The <strong>FLEX Turn Lanes</strong> button contains the following menu items:</p>
				<ol>
					<li></li>
				</ol>
			
				<!--images of FTL Standard items-->
			
				<h4 class="leftheading">Building FLEX Turn Lanes ("Quick" Method using QuickTurn)</h4>
				<p>The QuickTurn system is the quickest method to build FLEX Turn Lanes, though it does not cover all setups.  In order to build a QuickTurn setup, simply select the appropriate setup
				from the QuickTurn button, TABing through the options to select the desired setup, and using Home/End to rotate.  As QuickTurn setups are FLEX-based, one can always change the particulars of the turn
				lane configuration without necessarily having to bulldoze the entire setup and start again (as was the case with the old Turn Lane Extension Pieces).</p>
			

				<h4 class="leftheading">Building FLEX Turn Lanes ("Standard" Method)</h4>
				<p>The standard method for building FLEX Turn Lanes is much like the process of building standard NAM override network, though the "starters" for the FTLs are more like FLEX transitions, connecting
				networks to turn lane setups.</p>
				
				<p>To build intersections using the Type 110 FLEX Turn Lanes, or using the multi-tile types (Type 120, 220, or 130) to intersect single-tile networks, simply select the desired type, then use the base network to 
				extend the turn lane to the cross network.  The turn lane override will end upon reaching a cross network, and to complete the intersection, one will need to place another FLEX Turn Lane starter on the 
				opposite side, and drag through to complete the intersection.</p>

			
				<a href="images/ftl-intersection1.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/ftl-intersection1.jpg" alt="FTL Intersection 1"></a>
				
				<p>With Type 110 setups, when building T-intersections, one will need to use the Type 110 Median setup in order to complete the process, as continuing with the base Road network will create a jarring effect.</p>

				<a href="images/ftl-intersection2.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/ftl-intersection2.jpg" alt="FTL Intersection 2"></a>
				
				<p>In the case of building setups in which the FTL setup ends at a T-intersection with another network, or other factors with the design impact lane control (i.e. an intersection with a One-Way Road), 
				the arrow setup on the turn lanes will automatically change to match the particular setup.</p>
				
				<a href="images/ftl-intersection3.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/ftl-intersection3.jpg" alt="FTL Intersection 3"></a>
				
				<p>Because the setups are FLEX-based rather than being predicated on static puzzle pieces, it is possible to "edit" the intersections after the fact without having to bulldoze the entire setup.  For instance,
				the intersection above, with a Type 110 FTL ending at a Street, can be changed to end at a Road by simply dragging over the Street with the Road tool.</p>
	
				<a href="images/ftl-intersection4.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/ftl-intersection4.jpg" alt="FTL Intersection 4"></a>
				
				<p>When building intersections between two multi-tile networks, the FLEX Intersections must be used; simply dragging as with single-tile intersections will produce unpredictable and unstable results.</p>
				
				<p>Each FLEX intersection has a base type--for the dual-tile entries, the default is Type 120, whereas for the triple-tile entries, the default is Type 130.  These defaults can be changed by dragging a different
				type into the ends.  Note that with 4-way intersections, the side directly opposite it must also carry the same type, and asymmetrical setups are not possible.  The conversion process is shown below, with
				the Type 120 approaches on the left and right approaches of the intersection being exchanged for Type 220 approaches.</p>
				
				<a href="images/ftl-flex-intersection.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/ftl-flex-intersection.jpg" alt="FTL FLEX Intersection Conversion"></a>
			
				<h4 class="leftheading">Building Slip Lanes</h4>
				<p>To build a Slip Lane, start branching off the network using the One-Way Road tool, by building a one-tile One-Way Road stub.  Then, drag down from the One-Way Road stub with Road tool, as if to make a 90-degree bend off the 
				stub to create the slip.  The process is dependent on the drive-side one's game uses (except in the case of slip lanes between two One-Way Roads, which can go either way).  Both the RHD (traffic driving on the right)
				and LHD (traffic driving on the left) methods are shown below.</p>
			
				<a href="images/ftl-sliplanes.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/ftl-sliplanes.jpg" alt="FTL Slip Lane Construction"></a>
				
				<p>It is also possible to build Right-In-Right-Out (RIRO, for RHD users) or Left-In-Left-Out (LILO, for LHD users) using the Slip Lanes.  Construction of a RIRO setup in RHD is shown below; simply
				mirror the process to obtain a LILO in LHD.</p>
				
				<a href="images/ftl-riro.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/ftl-riro.jpg" alt="FTL RIRO Construction"></a>
				
				<p>All of these features combined can allow for seemingly complex setups such as this to be created, entirely using FLEX and draggable components.</p>
				
				<a href="images/ftl-showcase.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/ftl-showcase.jpg" alt="FTL Showcase"></a>
			
				<h4 class="leftheading">Building Crossings With Rail-Type Networks</h4>
				<p>To build a crossing with a Rail-type network on a stretch of FLEX Turn Lane, simply drag the desired network through the FTL, just as one would do with a standard Maxis network or NAM override network.
				Provided the network is supported, the crossing should appear--it's really that simple!  The image below shows how to build a RealRailway crossing through an FTL.</p>
				
				<a href="images/ftl-rail-crossing.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/ftl-rail-crossing.jpg" alt="FTL Rail Crossing with RRW DTR"></a>

				
				<p>Supported networks for crossings include the following.  Note that <strong>only Orthogonal networks</strong> are supported at present.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>RealRailway (RRW) Dual-Track Rail (DTR)</li>
						<li>RealRailway (RRW) Single-Track Rail (STR)</li>
						<li>RealRailway (RRW) L1 Dual-Track Rail (DTR)</li>
						<li>RealRailway (RRW) L2 Dual-Track Rail (DTR)</li>
						<li>Ground Light Rail (GLR)</li>
						<li>Elevated (Light) Rail</li>
						<li>Monorail</li>
						<li>High Speed Rail (HSR)</li>
					</ul>
					
			
				<h4 class="leftheading">A Note Regarding One-Way Road Intersections</h4>
				<p>FLEX Turn Lane setups involving One-Way Road intersections will only function properly if the arrows on the FTL are pointing such that they correspond to the direction of the One-Way Road, and in the
				case of 4-way intersections, is most stable if the One-Way Road is <a href="#sitap">SITAP-enabled</a>.  The Network Widening Mod's width variants of the One-Way Road network (OWR-1, OWR-3, OWR-4, and OWR-5) 
				are not supported at present.</p>
						
				<h4 class="leftheading">Unsupported Setups</h4>
				<p>The following setups are known to be unsupported by the current iteration of the FLEX Turn Lanes plugin, and will result in reversion to the underlying base network,
				and/or blocked traffic:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Any situation in which a FLEX Turn Lane Starter/Transition is placed immediately before an intersection.  (At least one tile of the FLEX Turn Lane setup must
					exist between the Starter/Transition and the intersection.)</li>
					<li>Any intersection in which one or more network is diagonal or at a fractional angle.</li>
					<li>Any intersection involving three or more different base network types.</li>
					<li>Any intersection involving crossings with Light Rail Dual-Networking (Elevated or Ground).</li>
					<li>Any intersection with a Street Addon Mod override network (click-around may resolve this to a situation where the FTL blocks the SAM override).</li>
					<li>Any intersection involving the Avenue network <em>without</em> a FLEX Turn Lane override applied (either Type 120 or 220 at present) will not allow inside turns (left turns if driving on the right,
					right turns if driving on the left). (This may actually be a beneficial exploit in some cases, and future FLEX Turn Lane development will explore turn restrictions further.)</li>
					<li>Any intersection directly involving a Network Widening Mod (NWM) override network, that has not been converted into a FLEX Turn Lane setup beforehand.  Networks that do
					not presently support transition into a FLEX Turn Lane setup (OWR-1, OWR-3, OWR-4, OWR-5, NRD-4, RD-4, and RD-6) cannot support intersections at present.  The TLA-3/5/7 and ARD-3 may produce a largely
					functional result in the case of FLEX Intersection setups, and the AVE-2 and AVE-6 will produce a partially functional setup, with a restriction on inside turn lane functionality (similar to what the base
					Avenue network will do).</li>
					<li>Any situation in which a network with FLEX Turn Lanes curves before reaching an intersection.</li>
					<li>Any situation involving RealHighway (RHW) networks, either with at-grade/same-level intersections, or undercrossings.</li>
					<li>Any situation involving the Draggable Elevated Road Viaducts.</li>
					<li>Any situation in which a Static Puzzle Piece interrupts a FLEX Turn Lane override before it reaches an intersection.  This includes the deprecated Turn Lane Extension Pieces (TuLEPs),
					the predecessor to the FLEX Turn Lanes.</li>
					<li>Any situation in which a Slip Lane is built right before a FLEX Turn Lane setup ends at a T-intersection.</li>
					<li>Any T-intersection in which the number of lanes on the ending network exceeds that of the through network (i.e. a Type 130 setup may not end at a T-intersection with a through Type 110 setup).</li>
					<li>Any intersection between a FLEX Turn Lane setup with two inside or outside turn lanes (i.e. Type 220) and a network with one travel lane per direction.</li>
					<li>Any intersection involving a One-Way Road (or NWM override thereof) in which the turn lanes on a FLEX Turn Lane setup would result into a turn into wrong-way traffic.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h4 class="leftheading">Other Known Issues</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Gaps may appear in wealth-level texturing when Slip Lanes are built on all four corners of a +-intersection, except in cases when the base Avenue network, or an override of it (i.e. a 
					Type 120 or 220 FLEX Turn Lane setup) is used as one of the crossroads.  There is no known solution to this aesthetic issue at present.</li>

			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="sitap"></a><h4>&nbsp;One-Way Road Signalized Intersection and Turn Arrow Project (SITAP)</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
			<p>Due to how Maxis implemented the One-Way Road network's directionality, locking it in a hardcoded tidal flow routine, the game's Network Rule (RUL) systems (which are the bread and butter of 
			what the NAM Team does) cannot tell the direction traffic is headed.  As a result, the One-Way Road network, by default, does not have functioning traffic signals.  The Signalized Intersection and Turn Arrow Project, or
			SITAP, is the NAM Team's answer to that, using a series of simple Pattern-Based Draggable workarounds to not only signal-enable intersections involving One-Way Roads, but also provide turn arrow features, 
			along the lines of what the FTL system provides.  Currently, only Orthogonal x Orthogonal setups are supported.</p>
			
			<p>The basic setup one would need to build depends on the cross network.  A few scenarios for SITAP-enabling intersections are shown below.  All of these are for 4-way intersections; simply omitting one leg will
			provide the pattern for a 3-way intersection.  The setup for the Avenues (and FTL Type 120) shown below is also the pattern for crossing Road-based multi-tile NWM override networks, and the setup for
			Roads will also work with the Road-based single-tile NWM networks, as well as the Type 110 FTLs.</p>
			
			<h5 class="leftheading">One-Way Road x One-Way Road</h5>

			<a href="images/sitap4.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/sitap4.jpg" alt="SITAP OWR x FTL Type 120"></a>			
			
			<p>At present, only the base One-Way Road network features SITAP support.  The Network Widening Mod width variants (OWR-1, OWR-3, OWR-4, and OWR-5) are not presently SITAP-enabled, though this functionality is planned
			for a future release.  (A FLEX piece-based option is also under consideration.)
			</div>
			
			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="sitap"></a><h4>&nbsp;Road Turning Lanes (Semi-Deprecated)</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>The old Road Turning Lanes (RTL) feature is still available, but due to interference from newer plugins, such as the Network Widening Mod, Draggable Elevated Road Viaducts, and Draggable Fractional Angle Roads, 
				<strong>Road Turning Lanes no longer automatically appear when Road x Road intersections are built.</strong>  This change has been in place since 2013, and there are no plans to bring back the automatic version.</p>
				<p>The Road x Road intersection turn lanes can still be activated at intersections of one's choosing by simply clicking over the intersection with the One-Way Road tool.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rtl.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rtl.jpg" alt="Road Turning Lanes Construction method"></a>
				
				<p>Note that any road construction in the vicinity of intersections with turning lanes generated in this manner may cause the turn lanes to disappear.  
				Simply click over the intersection with the One-Way Road tool once more to re-activate them.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="sitap"></a><h4>&nbsp;Avenue Turning Lanes (Deprecated)</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>The old Avenue Turning Lanes (ATL) feature is also still available, and remains as an automatic setup when a 4-way orthogonal Avenue x Avenue intersection is constructed.  Please note that having this
				feature installed may cause some stability issues with newer Avenue-related features.</p>

			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="sitap"></a><h4>&nbsp;Turn Lane Extension Pieces (TuLEPs) (Deprecated)</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>The Turn Lane Extension Pieces, or TuLEPs, are a series of puzzle pieces that allow for the construction of modular
				turn lane setups and slip lanes.  The TuLEPs set in the NAM includes turn lane pieces for Roads and Avenues (which can also be used by
				some Network Widening Mod networks), and slip lane pieces for Roads, One-Way Roads and Avenues.  There are two varieties of Turn Lane setups included,
				Type A (single left-turn lane/right-turn in LHD, included for Road and Avenue), and Type B (dual left-turn lanes/right-turn in LHD, included for Avenue), plus transitions to connect them to their base
				networks.<br>
				It is highly recommended to first drag out the base layout of the intersection on which you'd like to have turn lanes, and then simply place the
				puzzle pieces on top of this.  Because of the way in which the pieces had to be configured to allow them to be plopped over an existing network, it is <strong>
				highly recommended</strong> that one avoid using the bulldozer tool after "mistakes", as it can create a "cascade" that will require more rebuilding.
				Most TuLEPs puzzle pieces of the same base network type can be plopped over top of one another, and it is advised that one take this approach instead.
				</p>
				
				<p><strong>The Turning Lane (TuLEP) Puzzle Pieces</strong> Menu button (found on the Roads Menu) contains the following Puzzle Pieces:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Road Type A Transition/T-End Transition</li>
					<li>Road Type A1/A2</li>
