			<div class="regtext">
				<p>A mostly complete install (missing the upper elevated heights) of the RealHighway plugin is one of the features included by default if one selects the "Complete Standard Installation" or 
				"Networks and Traffic Simulator" options in the NAM Installer.  
				In Custom Installation, there is a whole section dedicated to the RealHighways and related optional features.</p>
				<p>In Custom Installation, under the "NAM Networks and Network Expansions" section, selecting the "Real Highway Mod" box will install the mod in its entirety.</p>
				
				<img class="screenshot" src="images/rhw-installer-1.jpg" alt="RHW in NAM Installer"</img>
				
				<p>By clicking the "+" to expand the menu further, one can select which RealHighway heights they wish to have installed. <strong>Note that the L3 and L4 RealHighways are not installed by default, and
				must be explicitly selected in Custom Installation.</strong></p> 

				<img class="screenshot" src="images/rhw-installer-2.jpg" alt="RHW in NAM Installer Expanded 1"</img>
				
				<p>One can also expand out further to select specific widths at the given heights.</p>
				
				<img class="screenshot" src="images/rhw-installer-3.jpg" alt="RHW in NAM Installer Expanded 2"</img>

				
				<p>Additional options for the RealHighway system can be found under the "RealHighway Additional Options" section.</p>
								
				<img class="screenshot" src="images/rhw-installer-5.jpg" alt="RHW Additional Features and Customizations 2"</img>
				
				<p><strong>Real Highway Regional Transport View</strong> will install the optional <a href="#region-view">RealHighway Regional Transport View Plugin</a>, which will allow one's RealHighway networks to be displayed
				on the Regional Transport View.  Note that one must activate a Data View in each city before saving in order for the RealHighways to appear on the map.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Single Median Barriers for Compact RHW Networks</strong> will give the C-type RHW networks a single median barrier, instead of a double barrier (the single option is actually selected by default).</p>

				<p><strong>Legacy Deprecated Height Transitions</strong> will install the older puzzle piece-based height transitions, which have (except for the Curved MIS transition, still under the button) all become outdated/deprecated
				with the addition of the new FLEXHeight transitions.</p>
				
				<p>Euro textures for the RealHighways will be automatically installed if one selects one of the Euro road texture options.  (Note that MandelSoft's older Euro texture options have been discontinued, as they
				are no longer being maintained.)</p>
				
				<img class="screenshot" src="images/rhw-installer-6.jpg" alt="RHW Euro Texture Options"</img>

				
				<p>Additionally, under the "Additional Bridges" portion of the "Additional Features and Customization" section, by clicking the "+" to expand the Real Highway Bridges subsection, 
				one can also select specifically which <a href="#bridges">RHW bridges</a> one wishes to install.</p>

			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="networks"></a><h4>&nbsp;RealHighway Base and Override Networks</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>The RealHighway system avails itself of the only unfinished network stub left in the game, and adds a true base network, the 2-lane RealHighway (RHW-2), along with 33 override networks
				based upon it.  With the exception of the Modular Interchange System (MIS) Ramp override network, the nomenclature used for RealHighway networks distinguishes the networks by the total number of lanes
				it would require to facilitate two-way traffic with the network.  For instance, while each individual tile of the 4-lane RealHighway (RHW-4) may only carry 2 lanes going in one direction, full bidirectional traffic
				with the network would require 2 stretches of the network traveling in opposite directions, thereby resulting in a total of 4 lanes.</p>
				<p>With some of the wider networks, the letters "S" or "C" may be added after the lane count designation (i.e. RHW-8S or RHW-6C).  The "S" is an indication for "separable", meaning that the lanes
				carrying travel in the opposite direction may be separated by any distance.  The "C" stands for "combined", and the center tile of the "C" override carries the median separating the two directions of traffic,
				thereby making it inseparable.  While the smaller networks do not have "S" or "C" suffixes, the RHW-2 and RHW-3 may be thought of as small C-type networks, and the MIS Ramp and RHW-4 as S-type networks.</p>
				<p>It is also possible to make <em>ad hoc</em> asymmetrical networks as well.  For instance, one could create a 5-lane highway by using the RHW-4 on one side, and an RHW-6S on the other.  The C-type networks,
				while not separable, also support this sort of functionality, and a dedicated starter exists for an "RHW-7C", which uses parts of the RHW-8C and RHW-6C for construction.</p>
				<p>There are also multiple elevation levels for the RealHighway override networks as well, and a simple shorthand system of denoting each level.  Ground-level networks, by virtue of having no elevation
				above the terrain, are deemed to be "Level 0", or L0.  The RealHighway levels increment by 7.5 meters (7.5m) each level.  Level 1 (L1) is at 7.5 meters, Level 2 (L2) at 15 meters, Level 3 (L3) at 22.5 meters, 
				and Level 4 (L4) at 30 meters.  All RealHighway widths have L1 and L2 elevation at their disposal, and the MIS Ramp, RHW-4, and RHW-6S all have the ability to reach L3 and L4.  Double-decker (DD) setups
				also exist (presently, only in a configuration with 4 total lanes, the DDRHW-4), and the upper deck of the DDRHW is at L2, while the lower deck is at L1.</p>
				
				<p>The base draggable network can be found under the RHW-2 button.</p>

				<p>All widths of the RealHighway have access to L1 and L2 elevations, which are produced with separate starters.  The MIS, RHW-4, and RHW-6S also have access to L3 and L4 elevations 
				(only installed by Custom Installation), and as previously mentioned, the RHW-4 also has a double-decker form, the DDRHW-4 (decks at L1 and L2).</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-elevations.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-elevations.jpg" alt="RHW Elevations"></a>
				
				<p>All of these override networks can either be constructed by first placing a
				Starter Piece, then dragging the appropriate default network through the starter, at which point the draggable network should convert to match the starter.  This process is shown below.</p>

				<p>In the case of multi-tile override networks, they are still based off default single-tile networks, mainly due to limitations with the game's default dual-tile networks, and lack of triple-tile networks.
				Simply use the same process for each tile in the starter to complete the network.</p>

				<h5 class="leftheading">Zone Access Restrictions</h5>
				
				<p>The RealHighway family of networks is considered to be Highway-type by the game, and as such, this limits its ability to provide direct access to zones and buildings, as one would
				expect from a highway.  This limitation is especially true of Residential (R) zones, which cannot be built at all along RHW networks, and attempting to have any zone type
				use RealHighway network frontage for access is not recommended.  It is instead recommended that one downgrade to a non-highway network, such as the Road, One-Way Road, or one of the <a href="../network-widening-mod/
				network-widening-mod.html">Network Widening Mod</a> override networks if zone access is required.</p>			
			</div>
			
			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="capacities"></a><h4>&nbsp;Capacities and Speeds</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>The capacity of each network depends on the <a href="../traffic-sim/traffic-sim.html">Traffic Plugin</a> one has installed. Capacity is generally calculated on a per tile basis by the game, as the
				game cannot read the number of lanes.</p>
				<p>All RHW networks are also highway-type networks, meaning that they do not allow full access to RCI Zones. The capacities for the five standard capacity levels of the NAM Traffic Plugin are listed below.  
				Please note that these capacities listed are for the <em>full width</em> of the network, rather than the per-tile capacity.</p>  
				<p>Note that networks with crossover paths (i.e. the RHW-6C, RHW-8S, RHW-8C, and RHW-10S), and those that use a special workaround (the RHW-3, DDRHW-4, and RHW-6S) have a 25% boost on capacity over the normal
				per-tile figure for the base RHW network.	This boost can only be applied once, which is why the DDRHW-4, despite having one more lane than the RHW-3, has the same capacity.  A similar situation exists
				with the RHW-6C and RHW-8C, and the RHW-8S and RHW-10S.</p>
				
				<p>Note that these figures also apply to all elevated versions of each network width, such that the L0 RHW-4 will have the same capacity as its L1, L2, L3, and L4 counterparts.</p>

			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="disconnector"></a><h4>&nbsp;The Disconnector: A RealHighway-Safe Bulldozer</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>Due to the vestigial remnants of the unfinished network stub, the base RealHighway network possesses an auto-connect functionality, similar to the way the Street network operates.  This can
				make the network's behavior rather erratic when using the game's base Bulldoze tool, and may result in more being demolished than one intended, particularly when dealing with complicated interchanges
				constructed entirely from RealHighway components.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-bulldozer.jpg"><img class = "screencenter" src="images/rhw-bulldozer.jpg" alt="Bulldozer Mess with RHW"></a>
				
				<p>To combat this issue, the RealHighway plugin comes with an alternative demolition tool, known as the Disconnector, which can be found under the Disconnector button
				on the Highways menu.</p>  
				
				<p><img src="images/rhw-disconnector-button.jpg" alt="Disconnector Button"> <em>RHW Disconnector Button</em></p>
				
				<p>Plopping the Disconnector over a single tile of RealHighway, including starter pieces, FLEX pieces, and intersections (but not puzzle pieces) will demolish only the tile directly under the cursor.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-disconnector-use.jpg"><img class = "screencenter" src="images/rhw-disconnector-use.jpg" alt="Disconnector Cleanliness with RHW"></a>
				
				<p>The Disconnector is also used as part of some Pattern-Based Draggable setups used by the RealHighway plugin, particularly the <a href="#dri">Draggable Ramp Interfaces (DRIs)</a>.  Additionally, it can be used
				in many situations with non-RHW networks as well.</p>
			</div>

			
			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="diagonals"></a><h4>&nbsp;Constructing Diagonals and Base Curves</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>With the networks that are single-tile (RHW-2, RHW-3), or have self-contained single-tile halves (MIS, RHW-4, RHW-6S), one can simply drag the network out as would be normally expected in order to
				produce the curves to go diagonal with the network.  Aside from the L0 RHW-2, however, the shared-tile "double diagonal" setup cannot be built, and pairs of MIS, RHW-4, and/or RHW-6S carriageways
				must be separated, out into a split-tile setup.</p>
								
				<p>For the wider RHW networks (the RHW-8S, RHW-10S, RHW-6C, and RHW-8C), the split-tile diagonal setup must be used.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-multitile-diagonals.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-multitile-diagonals.jpg" alt="RHW Multi-Tile Diagonals"></a>
				
				<p>The default sharp 90-degree bends are only available with the RHW-2 and MIS Ramp networks (at all height levels), for the sake of realism.  The MIS Ramp's version also overrides one "buffer tile" on either side
				of the bend itself, to produce a smoother result (one should take care not to impose upon these buffer tiles when building, as attempting to cram an intersection where they should go will simply
				destabilize the MIS Ramp override).</p>
				
				<p>If one desires a smoother transition between orthogonal and diagonal, <a href="#multi-radius">Wide-Radius Curves and Multi-Radius Curves</a> provide a solution.

			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="connection"></a><h4>&nbsp;Connecting RealHighways via Intersections, Crossings and Interchanges</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>The RealHighway system has two ways of connecting and crossing other networks: <strong>At-Grade</strong> and <strong>Grade-Separated</strong>.  The smaller RealHighway networks,
				including the RHW-2 (L0-L2), RHW-3 (L0 only), MIS (L0-L2), and RHW-4 (L0-L2), have the ability to intersect and cross other networks at the same height level.  To build these crossings,
				simply drag the desired RealHighway network through or up to the crossing network to build the type of crossing you want, just as one would with any other draggable network in the game.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-atgrade-int.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-atgrade-int.jpg" alt="RHW At-Grade Intersection"></a>
				
				<p>For grade-separated crossings, where networks at different height levels--for instance, an L1 RHW-4 and the game's default Elevated Rail network (which is at L2)--follow the same exact process.
				All RealHighway networks at all height levels support grade-separated crossings.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-elcrossing.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-elcrossing.jpg" alt="RHW Over/Undercrossing"></a>
				
				<h4 class="leftheading"><a name="rampbasics"></a>On/Offramp (Ramp Interface) Basics</h4>

				<p>Since not all RealHighway networks support At-Grade Intersections/Crossings, but all do support Grade-Separated Crossings, if one does wish to provide access to another road-type network, or another
				RealHighway (RealHighways cannot build interchanges with Maxis Highways), one must use exit and entrance ramps and build an interchange, in order to connect the two networks.  Unlike the Maxis Elevated and
				Ground Highways, the RealHighway system does not include single-piece/pre-fabricated "plop" interchanges (though this will change in a future release).  Instead, it relies on a 
				Modular Interchange System (MIS), in which the user assembles the interchange out of multiple smaller components.  While this approach is more complex, it allows for much greater control over the design of interchanges, and opens the door
				for considerable user creativity.  Interchanges will also take up more space than the hyper-condensed, pre-fabricated ones for the Maxis Highways, as the RealHighway is designed more to allow for realistic-scale 
				interchanges.</p>
				
				<p>At the core of the RealHighway's interchange system are the <strong>Ramp Interfaces</strong>, which allow exit and entrance ramps to branch off from or merge into the through lanes, or "mainline", of 
				a stretch of highway.</p>
				
				<img class="screenshot" src="images/rhw-rampinterface-anatomy.jpg" alt="RHW Ramp Interface Anatomy">
				
				<p>There are three possible ways to construct Ramp Interfaces:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>FLEXRamps, which are ploppable, generally slope-tolerant, and conform to match the surrounding network via overrides.  These can be found under the "FLEXRamps" button.<br>
					<img src="images/rhw-flexramps-button.jpg" alt="RHW FLEXRamps Button"></li>
					<li>Draggable Ramp Interfaces (DRI), which are Pattern-Based Draggable items, built by dragging the RealHighway network tool according to a specific pattern.  Like the FLEXRamps,
					these will conform to match the surrounding network via overrides.</li>
					<li>Puzzle Piece Ramp Interfaces, which are conventional static puzzle pieces, many of which have starters attached to their ends.  As these are static ploppables, they will not
					conform to the surrounding network, and one must select the specific puzzle piece for the desired network.  This option is largely considered to be deprecated/outdated, with the
					exception of the few more specialized setups that have yet to receive FLEXRamp or DRI treatments.  These can be found under the "Ramps" button.<br>
					<img src="images/rhw-old-ramps-button.jpg" alt="RHW Old Ramps Button"></li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Note that there are some types of ramps that may only be possible through a certain construction method.  FLEXRamps and DRIs are the preferred method for most ramp interfaces,
				and are the only option for most ramps involving elevated RealHighway networks.  The puzzle piece method does presently contain a few specialized types that have not been made into
				FLEXRamp or DRI setups, however.  A full listing of capabilities can be found <a href="#capabilities">here</a>, and there is also a listing of all <a href="#menu">ploppable items (including
				FLEX and Puzzle Pieces)</a>.  More details on constructing each type can be found below.</p>
				
				<p>In order to use a ramp interface to connect a RealHighway to one's surface network, first, build the desired ramp interface.  Then, from the end of the branch, simply drag the 
				RealHighway network tool out from it, just like using a starter piece.  The network will convert to match the ramp.  From there, simply continue dragging in the desired pattern, adding
				curves and transitions as necessary, and intersect the surface street with an At-Grade Crossing. (Note that the Fractional Angle ramps, Types C and F, do not support dragging, and the appropriate 
				Fractional Angle RealHighway (FARHW) puzzle pieces must be used instead.)</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-ramp-to-road.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-ramp-to-road.jpg" alt="RHW Ramp to Road"></a>
				
				<p>In order to connect to another RealHighway, follow the same process, but instead of forming an At-Grade Crossing, simply connect the ramp into another Ramp Interface on the 
				other RealHighway.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-ramp-to-ramp.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-ramp-to-ramp.jpg" alt="RHW Ramp to Ramp"></a>

				<p>There are a number of different types of Ramp Interfaces included in the plugin, but at their core, they serve one purpose--to connect RealHighway-based freeways/motorways to the surface 
				streets, or other RealHighway-based freeways/motorways.  There are two, sometimes three or even four parts to the name of each ramp interface type. These indicate the mainline width, the branch angle and width, 
				as well as whether any of the branch lanes were "exit only" or "acceleration" lanes, added or subtracted from the mainline. Some more specialized ramp interfaces may append that fourth part, containing other 
				information about the nature and location of the branch in relation to the mainline.  The mainline portion will always indicate the width of the "top" portion of the ramp interface, where the mainline is guaranteed 
				to be at its widest. In the case of FLEXRamps, since they are often shared by multiple networks, which override a base version, the mainline network is usually excluded from the in-game description. 
				For the "type" designation, the number indicates the number of lanes included in the branch, while the letter indicates the branch angle and indicates whether the branch has any lanes that peel off (on exit) 
				or join (on entrance) the mainline. The letter/number types translate as follows:</p>

					There is only one Folded ramp interface, the RHW-2 D1 Folded.</li>
					<li><strong>Diagonal</strong>: This designation indicates that the mainline is diagonal rather than orthogonal. The branch angles are handled the same as if the ramp were orthogonal 
					(i.e. an orthogonal ramp branch off a diagonal ramp interface would still be an A or D-type ramp of some sort).</li>
					<li><strong>FA</strong>: This designation indicates that the mainline is at a fractional angle rather than orthogonal.

				</ul>
				
				<h4 class="leftheading"><a name="flexramps"></a>Using FLEXRamps</h4>
				<p>FLEXRamps are ploppable FLEX on/offramp pieces, and are perhaps the easiest to navigate option to branch ramps off one's RealHighway system.  The FLEXRamp pieces may be found under the 
				FLEXRamps button on the Highways menu.  To use the FLEXRamps, simply find the desired
				ramp design, and plop it down.  Each FLEXRamp has a default network, but will convert to match if one drags another RHW override network through it, or plops the ramp over an existing stretch of an 
				RHW override network.  The process is shown below (the process of overriding the base setup of the Draggable Ramp Interfaces is identical):</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-flexramp-override.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-flexramp-override.jpg" alt="RHW FLEXRamp Override"></a>
				
				<p>Due to the use of special network flags, FLEXRamps are relatively slope-tolerant, particularly compared to other ramp interface options.</p>
				
				<p>Below is a list of the default networks for each FLEXRamp:</p>
				<table>
					<tr class="tablerow-alt">
						<th>Ramp</th><th>Default Network</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Type A1</td><td>RHW-2</td>

					<p>With the wider RHW networks (provided they are supported by the particular FLEXRamp type--see the piece description in game), for most situations, simply align the ramp interface with the shoulder tile for
					standard ramps, and with the median tile for the inside ramps.  If trying to build an RHW-8S Type D2 or E2 setup, however, one should instead align it with the median tile.  (Note also that the elevated
					versions of the RHW-6S do not support Type A1 setups, and the elevated versions of the RHW-8S do not support Type A1 setups, due to the overhang on the RHW-6S network.)</p>

				<h4 class="leftheading"><a name="dri"></a>Building Draggable Ramp Interfaces (DRIs)</h4>
				<p>Draggable Ramp Interfaces, or DRIs, are ramp interfaces that are constructed as Pattern-Based Draggables, using the RealHighway network. With the exception of a very few specialized setups, virtually every 
				RHW ramp interface setup can be built through draggable means, and at present, there are some ramps that are only possible as DRIs. Each ramp interface type supported by the system has a special drag pattern, 
				which, when constructed, will subsequently convert into the appropriate on/offramp.</p>
				<p>The below Table of DRI Patterns shows the exit ramp (entrance ramp for Left-Hand Traffic) setup. The corresponding entrance (or exit in Left-Hand Traffic) can be constructed by using the mirror image 
				of these patterns.  The process for overriding a FLEXRamp to have another RHW network as a mainline is identical to that of the FLEXRamps, as shown above.
				Elevated ramp interfaces can be constructed by dragging the appropriate elevated RHW network (L1-L4) or double-decker RHW through the DRI, which, provided the particular setup is 
				supported by that network, will elevate the ramp. Many setups for narrower networks can be transformed into corresponding versions for wider networks by using the same method. 
				This conversion is most reliable if the overriding network is dragged into the top end of the mainline.</p>
				<p>Since the drag patterns involve the creation of intersections, the point where the actual mainline/branch split occurs will result in flat terrain, but the rest of a DRI is not limited in this regard.</p>
				<p>The table below shows all of the basic drag patterns for the DRIs:</p>
				<p><em>(Click for full resolution)</em></p>
				<a href="images/Dri-table.png"><img class="screencenter" src="images/Dri-table.png" alt="DRI Drag Patterns"></a>
				
				
				<h4 class="leftheading"><a name="ppri"></a>Older Puzzle Piece Ramp Interfaces</h4>
				<p>A set of Puzzle Piece Ramp Interfaces also exists.  While it was the original method for constructing ramp interfaces, it has largely become a deprecated method, aside from the few setups not covered
				otherwise, due to the demands it places on the menu system.  The Puzzle Piece Ramp Interfaces exist under two buttons, the Puzzle Piece Ramp Interfaces button, and the 
				Fractional Angle Ramp Interfaces button (which contains all the Type C and Type F ramps). One must find the precise puzzle piece needed for the particular setup on the desired network, and place it.
				As static puzzle pieces, these ramp interfaces cannot carry overrides.</p>
				<p>Most (but not all) of the Puzzle Piece Ramp Interfaces have starters attached on their mainline approaches and branches, which does allow one to use them without having to place additional starters,
				but the presence of these starters also severely limits their slope tolerance.  As such, they can generally only be used on flat terrain, or they will end up flattening parts of slopes.
				If the puzzle-based interface does not have a starter stub on its ends (as it the case with most of the Fractional Angle types), one must place it after constructing the base network, 
				and a portion of the ramp.</p>
				
				<h4 class="leftheading"><a name="quickchange"></a>QuickChange: A Shortcut to Quicker Interchanges</h4>
				<p>In addition to the ramp interfaces, a series of "shortcuts" exist, in the form of the FLEX-based QuickChange (QC) pieces.  The QuickChanges include a base ramp interface (Type A1 by default) with a height transition 
				already attached, and provide quadrants for standard diamond and parclo (partial-cloverleaf) interchanges.  To build a QuickChange setup, simply place the desired setup, and as needed, drag an override network through the mainline
				portion (or plop it over an existing override network), after which point it will change to match.</p>
				
				<p>The QuickChange pieces may be found under the QuickChange button on the Highways menu.</p>
				<p><img src="images/rhw-qc-button.jpg" alt="RHW QuickChange Button"> <em>QuickChange Button</em></p>

				<p>QuickChange still operates with the RealHighway's modular design philosophy in mind, and as such, is possible to swap in a different ramp interface type for the default Type A1 (such as a Type D1), 
				simply by plopping the other ramp interface over the existing one.</p>
				
				<a href="images/qc-ramp-change.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/qc-ramp-change.jpg" alt="QuickChange Ramp Change"></a>
				
				
				<h4 class="leftheading"><a name="qcdiamond"></a>Tutorial: Simple Diamond Interchange with QuickChange</h4>	
				<p>To build a diamond interchange with the QuickChanges, in which the L1 RHW-4 crosses over a Road, first begin with the L1 RHW-4 Starter Pieces, and drag out with the RealHighway network tool to continue the overrides.
				Then, drag the Road underneath.  Following that, place four QuickChange L1 RHW Partial Diamond pieces encircling the Road.  The L1 RHW-2 base mainline of the QuickChanges should covert to match the L1 RHW-4 (if L1 RHW-2 lingers,
				simply click around the vicinity of the unconverted sections with the RealHighway network tool to get them to cooperate).  After this, use the RealHighway network tool to drag between the height transitions, right through
				the Road.  This will form the intersections between the ramps and the Road, thereby completing the interchange.</p>
				
				
				<a href="images/qc-diamond.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/qc-diamond.jpg" alt="QuickChange Diamond Tutorial"></a>
				
				<p>This process can easily be adapted to other RHW networks, other surface street options (such as Avenues or Network Widening Mod networks), and to variants where the RHW is at ground level, and the surface street crosses
				over using one of the <a href="../road-viaducts/road-viaducts.html">Draggable Elevated Road Viaducts</a>.</p>			
			</div>
						
			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="transition"></a><h4>&nbsp;Transitioning to Other Networks</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>There are three types of transitions that exist in the RealHighway plugin: Height Transitions, Width Transitions, and Other Network Transitions.  The first two cover cases between two RealHighway networks,
				while the latter covers transitions to non-RealHighway networks, i.e. Maxis and Network Widening Mod (NWM) networks.</p>
				<p>There are two methods of constructing Height Transitions, both of which involve ploppable items: the FLEX-based FLEXHeight system (found under the "FLEXHeight" button), 
				and the conventional puzzle piece approach (found under the "Height Transitions" [Ht. Trans.] button).  The FLEXHeight system is the more full-featured of the two, and there is only one
				situation (a 90-degree curved MIS transition) that presently requires a puzzle piece.</p>
				
				<p><img src="images/rhw-flexheight-button.jpg" alt="RHW FLEXHeight Button"> <em>RHW FLEXHeight Button</em></p>
				<p><img src="images/rhw-old-height-button.jpg" alt="RHW Old PP Height Button"> <em>RHW Height Transition Puzzle Pieces Button (<strong>Only</strong> installed if <a href="#installation">"Legacy Height Transitions"</a> 
				option is selected.)</em></p>

				
				<p>There are two subtypes of Height Transitions: "Ramp-Style" and "On-Slope".  The former is designed for use on (relatively) level ground, and uses a multi-tile rise to get the RealHighway up to the desired
				height, and presently only exists in an orthogonal version.  The latter is for use on an embankment, and exists in an orthogonal version, and a (limited) diagonal form.  In order to ensure proper placement on
				the OnSlope transitions, use of the NAM's <a href="../base-network/base-network.html">Hole Diggers and Raisers</a> is recommended.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-ht-types.jpg"><img class="screenshot" src="images/rhw-ht-types.jpg" alt="RHW Height Transition Types"></a>
				
				<p>The standard FLEXHeight transitions default to the base RHW-2 network (producing an elevated version of the RHW-2, either L1 or L2 out the other end).  If wishing to simply use the RHW-2 network, plopping the piece down
				is all that is needed.  (The 180-degree MIS Ramp transition is MIS-only, however, and dragging an RHW-2 into it will produce either an L0 or L1 MIS Ramp, depending on the end.) 
				If using an On-Slope version, only drag the RHW network up to the <em>edge</em> of the transition, <strong>NOT through</strong>, in order to preserve the embankment.</p>
				
				<h5 class="leftheading">Ramp-Style Usage</h5>
				<a href="images/rhw-flexheight-use-1.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-flexheight-use-1a.jpg" alt="FLEXHeight 1a"></a>
				
				<h5 class="leftheading">On-Slope Usage</h5>
				<a href="images/rhw-flexheight-use-1.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-flexheight-use-1b.jpg" alt="FLEXHeight 1b"></a>
				
				<p>To override the base RHW-2 configuration of the FLEXHeight transitions, either Ramp-Style or On-Slope, simply drag the desired override network into either end, and it will convert to match.  If any tiles refuse to convert, simply click over
				the first point where the override stops complying, and it should convert.  Placing starters on both sides of the transition ensures maximum stability.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-flexheight-use-2.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-flexheight-use-2.jpg" alt="FLEXHeight 2"></a>
				
				<p>If using a multi-tile network, simply place multiple FLEXHeight transitions adjacent to one another, and drag each tile of the multi-tile network into the ends of the transition.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-flexheight-use-3.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-flexheight-use-3.jpg" alt="FLEXHeight 3"></a>
				
				<p>It is also possible to transition between two different elevations (i.e. L1 and L2 instead of L0 and L1), simply by plugging the appropriate overrides into the ends.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-l1-l2-transition.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-l1-l2-transition.jpg" alt="L1-L2 Transition"></a>
				
				<p>Additionally, 3-Level and 4-Level Ramp-Style transitions can be built by overlapping the ends of multiple FLEXHeight 1-Level or 2-Level pieces.  Note that this can only be done with networks that support
				the L3 and L4 elevation (the RHW-4, MIS Ramp, and RHW-6S).</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-l0-l3-transition.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-l0-l3-transition.jpg" alt="L0-L3 Transition"></a>
				
				<p>The Width Transitions currently only exist in conventional puzzle piece form, and are all found under the "Width Transitions" button.</p>
				<p><img src="images/rhw-width-transition-button.jpg" alt="RHW Width Transitions Button"> <em>RHW Width Transitions Button</em></p>

				
				<p>To build a width transition, simply find the desired puzzle piece by
				using TAB/Shift-TAB to cycle through the options, and place it.  Most Width Transitions already have starters on the ends--note, however, that this fact significantly limits the slope tolerance of these transitions.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-wt-use.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-wt-use.jpg" alt="Width Transition"></a>
				
				<p>Transitions to non-RealHighway networks are accomplished simply by dragging the RealHighway and non-RealHighway network to meet.  If the setup is supported, the transition will override to match
				the involved networks.</p>

				<h5 class="leftheading">Multi-Radius Curves (MRCs) [FLEX/Draggable]</h5>
				<p>The Multi-Radius Curves are a series of wider-radius curves that are constructed through either draggable means or with FLEX pieces.  There are five radii total included in the MRC system--R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5.  
				The higher the number, the wider the radius (i.e. R2 has a wider radius than R1).  
				As with many items, they default to the RHW-2, but they can support up to the RHW-6S width--more details as to precisely what is supported can be found <a href="#capabilities">here</a>.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-mrc-radii.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-mrc-radii.jpg" alt="RHW MRC Radii"></a>
				
				<p>R1 curves, also known as "Mini-Curves", are constructed by draggable means, and can be easily constructed with a simple additional motion when building the default network curves.  Simply drag in a straight, 
				orthogonal motion through the entire default curve.  Afterward, a smoother curve will appear.  Alternatively, one can simply try to drag the curve to the diagonal one tile before an end stub, which will also 
				trigger the R1 curve.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-mrc-r1.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-mrc-r1.jpg" alt="RHW MRC R1"></a>
				
				<p>Note that with the RHW-6S, due to the overhang, a "bite" may appear to be missing from some curve setups.  Simply click in the area of the missing "bite" with the RealHighway network tool to fill it.</p>
	
				<a href="images/rhw-mrc-r1-rhw6s.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-mrc-r1-rhw6s.jpg" alt="RHW MRC R1 for RHW-6S"></a>
				
				<p>R2 45 curves may be constructed either via draggable means or FLEX pieces.  For the draggable R2 setup, drag the default curve as usual, and then build a 90 bend on the inside of the curve, at which point it should convert.
				To build the FLEX piece, simply select it from the menu and place it.  The FLEX pieces--which include a 90 variant in addition to the 45 version--all default to the base L0 RHW-2 network, 
				but dragging an override network into a FLEX MRC piece, or plopping one over top of an existing stretch of override network will cause it to convert to match, provided the network is supported 
				for that particular setup.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-mrc-use-2.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-mrc-use-2.jpg" alt="RHW MRC Construction 2"></a>
				
				<p>Note also that the orthogonal ends of R2 curves can, in fact, overlap, allowing for one to create a smooth composite curve, which can be very useful in building aesthetically-pleasing
				interchange ramps.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-mrc-r2-overlap.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-mrc-r2-overlap.jpg" alt="RHW MRC R2 Overlap Technique"></a>
				
				<p>The R3, R4, and R5 radii only exist as FLEX pieces, and can be constructed the same way as the R2 FLEX piece.  They do not, however, support the overlap/composite curve functionality of the R2 curves.</p>
								
				<p>The Multi-Radius Curves do not support the creation of intersections or crossings at any point in the curve, and attempting to build one will destabilize the curve.  The <a href="#flexfly">FLEXFly system</a> 
				does allow for an equivalent functionality, however.</p>
				
				<h5 class="leftheading">Wide-Radius Curves (WRCs) [Puzzle]</h5>
				
				<p>In addition to the MRCs, a series of puzzle piece-based Wide-Radius Curves (WRCs) also exists, which at least partially cover all ground-level RealHighway networks.  S-Curves exist for all networks, 
				45 curves exist for all but the RHW-6C and 8C, and 90 curves (in two radii--small and large) exist for the RHW-2 and MIS Ramps.</p>
				
				<p>The Wide-Radius Curve puzzle pieces do <strong>NOT</strong> have starters on their ends, unlike many other older puzzle-based RealHighway items, and being puzzle-based, do not support overrides.
				As such, they generally must be built on top of an existing stretch of a RealHighway network.  The network must already exist up to the point at which the curve piece begins.
				With S-Curves/Lane Shifts, the presence of base network stubs may allow one to simply place starters oneself on either end.</p>

				<a href="images/rhw-wrc-use-1.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-wrc-use-1.jpg" alt="RHW WRC Construction"></a>
				
				<p>The S-Curves for the RHW-6C and RHW-8C are built in a modular fashion as well, to allow support for the asymmetrical "RHW-7C" setup.  Simply build the full curve one half at a time.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw6c-s-curve"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw6c-s-curve.jpg" alt="C-Type RHW S-Curve"></a>
				
				<p>It is possible to also build larger composite 90 turns with the single-tile networks, using the RHW Filler Pieces, but this functionality does not exist for the RHW-8S, 10S, 6C, or 8C.</p>
				
				<!--show composite 90-->

			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="flexfly"></a><h4>&nbsp;Using the FLEXFly (Flexible Flyover) System</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>The FLEXFly (Flexible Flyover) pieces are FLEX-based curved flyover ramps, which can be crossed under or over by almost every RealHighway network (<strong>except for the L0 RHW-2</strong>, for the purposes
				of stability).  They can be found under the FLEXFly button on the Highways menu.</p>  
				<p><img src="images/rhw-flexfly-button.jpg" alt="RHW FLEXFly Button"> <em>RHW FLEXFly Button</em></p>
				
				<p>The FLEXFly pieces come in two angles--90 and 45--and both single-lane/MIS Ramp-based or dual-lane/RHW-4-based versions are available, at height levels from
				L0 to L2.  Their curve radii are equivalent to the R2 Multi-Radius Curves.
				</p>
				
				<p>To use a FLEXFly piece, first place the desired setup.  Each FLEXFly will allow draggable orthogonal crossings at any point in the curve, provided the crossing network is at different height level than the FLEXFly itself.
				To create these crossings, just drag the network under/over the FLEXFly.  To continue the flyover ramp, just drag out from the ends of the FLEXFly, just as if it were a starter piece, or connect it to other
				RealHighway-related items (like height transitions) as desired.</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-flexfly-use-1.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-flexfly-use-1.jpg" alt="FLEXFly Usage"></a>
				
				<p>Note that FLEXFly pieces can only support a single crossing network at any given point.  It is also not possible to have a FLEXFly piece cross over another FLEXFly piece--the result of this will be a blank tile
				at the point where the two collide.  Additionally, FLEXFly pieces do not support the overlap/composite technique of the R2 Multi-Radius Curves.</p>

			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="farhw"></a><h4>&nbsp;Fractional Angle RealHighways (FARHW)</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>One can also further their "grid-busting" efforts with the RealHighway system with the use of the Fractional Angle RealHighway (FARHW) Puzzle Pieces.  The FARHW pieces allow one to build RealHighways at 
				angles other than orthogonal and diagonal--currently, only 18.4/71.6 (or "FA-3", as it is known in Fractional Angle Network nomenclature).
				</p>
				
				<a href="images/rhw-farhw-sample.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-farhw-sample.jpg" alt="RHW FARHW Sample"></a>
				
				<p>The FARHW pieces exist under three different buttons--the main FARHW pieces button, which contains the base fractional angle network pieces, and curves to connect to orthogonal and diagonal networks, the 
				FARHW Ramp Interfaces button, which contain ramp interfaces involving FARHW connections (including the Type C1, C2, F1, F2, and C3 ramps), and the FARHW Intersections and Transitions button, which contains
				intersection pieces with FARHW approaches, as well as width transitions between different FARHW widths.</p>

				<a href="images/rhw-farhw-use.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/rhw-farhw-use.jpg" alt="RHW FARHW Use"></a>
				
				<p>Note that, with the exception of the FARHW Ramp Interfaces, none of the other FARHW pieces have starters on their ends, much like the Wide-Radius Curves, so one must be sure to place the orthogonal or diagonal
				ends of curves over an existing stretch of network.</p>

			<div class="regtext">
				<p>The Cosmetic Pieces are a set of puzzle pieces that are designed to allow one to exercise finer control of the look of their RealHighways, particularly with lane markings, such as auxiliary lane and HOV lane
				markings.  Due to their sheer number (166 total at present), the Cosmetic Pieces are divided under four separate buttons, one for each tile width possibility (1-tile, 2-tile, and 3-tile), and one for

			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="bridges"></a><h4>&nbsp;Bridges</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>The NAM does include bridges for various RealHighway networks.  However, it is worth noting that there are some special caveats, due to a hardcoded restriction in the game's terrain engine, which prevents
				bridges from being built without at least a one-tile separation between them:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Bridges involving the wider S-type networks (RHW-8S and RHW-10S) must be built with the <em><strong>Maxis Ground Highway</strong></em> tool instead of the RealHighway tool.</li>
					<li>Bridges involving the wider C-type networks (RHW-6C and RHW-8C) are <strong>not possible</strong>.</li>
					<li>There are bridges available for adjacent RHW-4 and RHW-6S situations, also built with the Maxis Ground Highway tool.</li>
					<li>Bridges for RealHighway networks with separate carriageways (i.e. the MIS Ramps, RHW-4, RHW-6S, RHW-8S, RHW-10S, and DDRHW-4) will have their traffic flow determined by the way in which the 
					base network is dragged.  Take note of the preview models to ensure you have built the bridge in the correct direction.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>For the bridges that use the Maxis Highway as a base, there are overrides in place to seamlessly connect with the otherwise RealHighway-based networks.  In order to create this smooth transition,
				ensure that only the end stub of the Maxis Highway network is showing at each end of the bridge.  Then, simply drag each tile of the RealHighway override network into the Maxis Highway stubs.  They will convert
				to match the RealHighway.  This process is shown below.</p>

			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="neighbor"></a><h4>&nbsp;A Note Regarding Neighbor Connections</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>While the single-tile, two-way RealHighway networks (the RHW-2, RHW-3, and DDRHW-4) can form functioning neighbor connections the standard way, attempting to do this with any other 
				RealHighway network will result in only freight trucks being able to use the connection.  This is because the game cannot handle one-way neighbor connections, as would be required with the RHW-4, MIS, and the various
				wider networks. As a result, special Neighbor Connector (NC) pieces are required, in order to provide proper functionality for these override networks.  These puzzle pieces can be found under the RHW Neighbor Connector Pieces button.
				</p>
				<p><img src="images/rhw-nc-button.jpg" alt="RHW NC Button"> <em>RHW Neighbor Connector Pieces Button</em></p>

				<p>There are two types of pieces involved in RHW Neighbor Connections: Network Pieces and Invisible Loop Connectors.</p>  

				<p>To build the Neighbor Connection, build a standard Neighbor Connection through the normal draggable means with the network you wish to use.</p>
				
				<img src="images/rhwnc1.jpg" alt="rhwnc1">

				<p>Please note that no matter how you drag the RHW to the edge, the default yellow Neighbor Connection will <strong>always be facing the same way</strong>, unlike Avenue
				or Maxis Highway Neighbor Connections.  (There is no way to change this, nor any need to do so.)</p>
				
				<img src="images/rhwnc2.jpg" alt="rhwnc2">
				
				<p>Then find the RHW Neighbor Connector Pieces button, and TAB through to find and place the appropriate Network Piece over each network tile that will be part of the Neighbor Connection, on the the game's default yellow Neighbor Connection arrows, 
				simply lining up the white/yellow lines with your highway as appropriate:</p>
				
				<img src="images/rhwnc3.jpg" alt="rhwnc3">
				
				<img src="images/rhwnc4.jpg" alt="rhwnc4">
				
				<p>If the two sides of your RHW are separated by one or more tiles, place the Invisible Loop
				Connectors in the median area right next to the edge of the city tile, filling the gap.  The Invisible Loop Connectors, which look like a blue arrow with an "N" inside, when placed, will show up invisible,
				but you can easily locate them by hovering a query tool over top, which will cause an otherwise invisible 
				"ghost model" with the blue "N" arrow to appear:</p>
				
				<img src="images/rhwnc5.jpg" alt="rhwnc5">
				
				<p>Do <strong>not</strong> place the Invisible Loop Connectors directly over top of you network, as this is not what they were intended for and they will actually prevent your system from working.  
				Due to how the pieces have to be set up, it is also possible you will see "spider cars" going down the edge of your city tile, and the paths will be draped over the edge of the city tile.</p>
				
				<img src="images/rhwnc6.jpg" alt="rhwnc6">
				
				<p>For "Combined" ("C-type") networks, such as the RHW-6C and 8C, simply place the appropriate Neighbor Connector piece over top of the network at the edge of the city tile.</p>
				
				<img src="images/rhwnc7.jpg" alt="rhwnc7">	
				
				<p>In order for the connection to work properly, this process must be repeated identically in the neighboring city tile, and the traffic simulation must be given some time to run in both involved city tiles
				in order for the game to recognize that there is a valid connection.</p>
				
				<p><em>NOTE: Most of the elevated RealHighway override networks do not currently support Neighbor Connections.  This functionality will be added in a future release, when the Neighbor Connection functionality
				is converted to use FLEX pieces for the network-specific portions.</em></p>

			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="spui-ddi"></a><h4>&nbsp;A Note About Specialized Crossings: SPUIs, Diverging Diamonds, and Volleyball Interchanges</h4></div>

				<p>The RealHighway system includes the ability to recreate three oft-requested interchange designs: the Single-Point Urban Interchange (SPUI), the Diverging Diamond Interchange (DDI), and the Volleyball Interchange.  
				These are "advanced" features of the plugin, and it is recommended that you are already comfortable with
				the RealHighways, the NAM Elevated Viaducts and the either the FLEX Turn Lanes (FTL) or Turn Lane Extension Pieces (TuLEPs) before trying to build SPUIs or DDIs.
				</p>
				
				<p>The SPUI and DDI setups can be found under the RHW/Avenue Interface button on the Roads menu, while the Volleyball pieces can be found under the old puzzle-based Ramps button on the Highways menu.</p>

				<h5 class="leftheading">Single-Point Urban Interchange (SPUI)</h5>
				<p>The Single-Point Urban Interchange, or more commonly, SPUI, is a type of high-capacity, grade-separated
				interchange, introduced in February 1974 in Clearwater, Florida by engineer Wallace Hawkes.  While conventional diamond interchanges usually involve
				two separate intersections to provide access between a surface street and a highway, the SPUI combines the
				two intersections into a single intersection (usually with slip lanes), improving traffic flow.
				The RealHighway's SPUI functionality is provided via the FlexSPUI piece, found under the RHW x Avenue pieces button on the Roads menu.  
				As the name implies, this SPUI piece is a FLEX piece, which allows for the construction of a SPUI between several different RealHighway networks
				with several different configurations, including Elevated SPUIs.</p>
				
				<p><em>NOTE: FlexSPUI has not yet been fully upgraded to take advantage of the new height levels and coding improvements added to the RealHighway system as part
				of the Project 57 initiative in 2013, and the current version is in a somewhat deprecated state.  A future release of the NAM will incorporate a new, improved
				version of FlexSPUI, though the advice here will still remain at least somewhat applicable.</em>
				
				<p>In order to build a SPUI, place the FlexSPUI piece--it looks like half of a SPUI.</p>
				<img src="images/flexspui1.jpg" alt="flexspui1"><br>
				  
				<p>To complete the basic intersection, you'll need to plop another half of a SPUI.  This half can be plopped next to the first one:</p>
				<img src="images/flexspui2.jpg" alt="flexspui2"><br>
				  
				<p>Or you can put a small gap between them and fill it in with an Avenue:</p>
				<img src="images/flexspui3.jpg" alt="flexspui3"><br>
				<img src="images/flexspui4.jpg" alt="flexspui4"><br>
				  
				<p>In either case, make sure to bulldoze the "construction site handles" on the piece.  The ramp connections on the sides allow RHW-4 to be dragged out from them:</p>
				<img src="images/flexspui5.jpg" alt="flexspui5"><br>
				  
				<p>You can simply drag an elevated RHW over top of the FlexSPUI, like so:</p>
				<img src="images/flexspui6.jpg" alt="flexspui6"><br>
				  
				<p>In order to connect the Avenue end, use the either the Avenue Type 110 FLEX Turn Lanes or Turn Lane Extension Pieces:</p>
				<img src="images/flexspui7.jpg" alt="flexspui7"><br>
				  
				<p>It is also possible to elevate the FlexSPUI.  Simply place an L2 connection (such as a transition) next to the ramp connection
				on the SPUI (<em>NOTE: L1 did not exist when FlexSPUI was created</em>).  Most of one half of it will become elevated--simply click on the non-elevated part with the RHW network tool and it will raise up:</p>
				<img src="images/flexspui8.jpg" alt="flexspui8"><br>
				<img src="images/flexspui9.jpg" alt="flexspui9"><br>
				  
				<p>The overrides are most stable on the "incoming" part of the ramp connection ("outgoing" in Left-Hand Drive)--this shows the rest of the SPUI becoming elevated:</p>
				<img src="images/flexspui10.jpg" alt="flexspui10"><br>
				  
				<p>You can simply drag a ground-level RHW underneath the Elevated FlexSPUI, much as you dragged the Elevated RHW over the Ground FlexSPUI:</p>
				<img src="images/flexspui11.jpg" alt="flexspui11"><br>
				  
				<p>In order to connect the Avenue end, you will need to use the Avenue Type A On-Slope TuLEP.  The NAM's <a href="../base-network/base-network.html#raiser-digger">Hole Digger and Raiser</a> 
				feature is highly recommended in order to get the embankment to the proper elevation.</p>

				<h5 class="leftheading">Diverging Diamond Interchange (DDI)</h5>
				<p>The Diverging Diamond Interchange (DDI), sometimes also called "Crossing Diamond", is an interchange that
				originated in France, but has recently caught on with North American highway engineers, through the work of
				American traffic engineer Gilbert Chlewicki.  The Missouri Department
				of Transportation (MODOT) opened the first in the United States in Springfield on June 21, 2009.  Since then, many more have opened up across the world.  
				The DDI involves having traffic cross onto the "wrong" side of the road, which allows left turn movements flow more smoothly and
				traffic onto (and sometimes off) the freeway to go unsignalized, with only the through movements on the surface street requiring signalization.</p>

				<p>The RHW includes a special puzzle piece allowing for the construction of a DDI with an Avenue, which, like the FlexSPUI, is found under the RHW x Avenue button on the Roads menu.
				To build a DDI, place the special DDI intersection pieces on either side of your RHW, and connect Avenues into the appropriate
				ends of the pieces.  Use One-Way Roads and/or the draggable or puzzle piece-based <a href="../road-viaducts/road-viaducts.html">Elevated One-Way Road Viaducts</a> 
				(for an elevated DDI) to build the "wrong side" traffic sections between the DDI intersection pieces.  The connections to the RHW end are made via RHW-4.</p>

				<h5 class="leftheading">Volleyball Interchange</h5>
				
				<p>The Volleyball Interchange, also commonly known as a Three-Level Diamond, or Split-Level Diamond, is a three-level interchange, in which all turning motions are handled by at-grade intersections on a separate
				height level from through traffic.</p>
				
				<p>Under the old Puzzle Piece Ramp Interfaces button on the Highways menu, one can find a series of "Specialized Crossing Pieces" (SCPs) to handle Volleyball Interchange intersections.  To use them, simply place them
				down, and place starter pieces between each intersection to connect them.</p>

			<div class="regtext">
				<p>The NAM includes the popular RHW Regional Transport Map Mod by <strong>jondor</strong> as
				an optional feature, which can be selected <strong>via this option in the NAM Installer</strong>.  This mod utilizes a workaround to display RHWs on the Regional Transport Map.  
				It also contains an updated and expanded map legend to reflect the new network colors as well as the addition of Monorail as a separate color from El-Rail/GLR. <strong>This mod is NOT compatible with any other Regional Transport Map mods.</strong></p>
				<p>There is one requirement for the mod to function correctly: <strong>You <span class="underline">MUST</span> activate at least one dataview in game before saving for the game to render the map correctly.</strong>  It does not appear that this issue can be fixed.</p>
				<p>After instalation, each city tile must be opened and saved (after opening any dataview) in order to update the region map.  Similarly when uninstalling the mod, each city tile must be resaved to update the region map.</p>
				<p><strong>FAQ:</strong></p>
				<p>
					<strong>Q:</strong> Why are highways black instead of red?<br>
					<strong>A:</strong> Because of the way this workaround functions, the red color would show up as a halo around diagonal roads, bridges and certain puzzle pieces.  The black color does as well, but is less noticable.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Q:</strong> Why do the diagonals look weird?<br>
					<strong>A:</strong> Again, because of the way this workaround functions, the diagonal roads, avenues and streets show up intermingled with the highway color.  This is not possible to fix but the map colors were chosen to make it less noticable than other color combinations.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Q:</strong> Why are all my roads black?<br>
					<strong>A:</strong> If you do not open any of the dataviews before saving the game, the map will be rendered incorrectly resulting in all car traffic networks showing up as the highway color.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Q:</strong> Will you make a version with my favorite colors?<br>
					<strong>A:</strong> Sorry, but no.  Anyone who can use iLive's Reader can easily change the colors to their liking.<br></p>
