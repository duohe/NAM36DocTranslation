			<div class="regtext">
				<p>The Network Widening Mod adds 13 new override networks, which extend the game's base Road and One-Way Road networks by providing different width variants, many with higher capacities.  This includes 6 single-tile, 
				5 dual-tile, and 2 triple-tile override networks.  Among these networks are the Turning Lane Avenues (TLA), which feature a center turn lane/flush median, multi-lane variants of the Road network, and four additional 
				widths of the One-Way Road (OWR) network. It also includes some degree of diagonal functionality for all networks, transitions to connect NWM networks to Maxis networks or other NAM override networks, 
				a series of Wide-Radius Curve pieces for three of the single-tile networks, and neighbor connector puzzle pieces for selected networks.</p>

			<div class="regtext">
			<p>The NWM is one of the features included by default if one selects the "Complete Standard Installation" or "Networks and Traffic Simulator" options in the NAM Installer.  In Custom Installation, there is a whole
			section dedicated to the NWM and related optional features.</p>
			<p>In Custom Installation, selecting the "Network Widening Mod" box will install the mod.</p>
			
			<img class="screenshot" src="images/nwm-installer1.jpg" alt="NWM in NAM Installer"</img>
			
			<p>By clicking the "+" to expand the menu further, one can select which NWM networks they wish to have installed (due to shared components, the triple-tile networks must be installed together).  The <strong>Legacy Puzzle Wealthification</strong> option adds wealth-dependent grass/sidewalk textures to many of the
			older NWM Transition Puzzle Pieces.  Note, however, that this option may not work with all graphics cards, due to Z-fighting settings, and the introduction of draggable transitions (first seen in NAM 30/NWM 2.0), which
			provide much better support for grass/sidewalks render most (but not all) of the old puzzle pieces obsolete.</p>

			<div class="regtext">
				<h4 class="leftheading">&nbsp;Overview</h4>
				<p>The Network Widening Mod (NWM) plugin includes a total of 13 different override networks, which can be grouped into four classes: <strong>Roads (RD)</strong>, <strong>One-Way Roads (OWR)</strong>, 
				<strong>[Road-based] Avenues (AVE)</strong>, and <strong>[Road-based] Turning Lane Avenues (TLA)</strong>.</p>
				
				<p>All of these override networks can either be constructed by first placing a
				Starter Piece, then dragging the appropriate default network through the starter, at which point the draggable network should convert to match the starter.  This process is shown below on a Road-based
				NWM Override Network.</p>
				
				<p><em>(Click for full resolution)</em></p>
				<a href="images/tla3-starter-steps.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/tla3-starter-steps.jpg" alt="Single-Tile NWM Starter"></a>
				
				<p>In the case of multi-tile override networks, they are still based off default single-tile networks, mainly due to limitations with the game's default dual-tile networks, and lack of triple-tile networks.
				Simply use the same process for each tile in the starter to complete the network.</p>

				<h5 class="leftheading">&nbsp;Turning Lane Avenues (TLA) [Road-based]</h5>
				<p>The Turning Lane Avenues, or TLAs, are Road-based override networks that include a paved/flush center turn lane running down the median, as is especially common in North America.  In the case of the 
				multi-tile variants, the existence of this center turn lane allows for vehicles to directly access buildings and lots on the far side of the network--something which the game's default Avenue 
				network does not allow.</p>
				<p>There are three total TLA networks presently included in the NWM (note that the center turn lane <em>is</em> included in the lane count associated with each network).</p>
				<span class="leftcolumn">
					<ul>
						<li>3-Lane Turning Lane Avenue (TLA-3) [Single Tile]</li>
						<li>5-Lane Turning Lane Avenue (TLA-5) [Dual Tile]</li>

					<img class="screenleft" src="images/nwm-tla-networks.jpg" alt="TLA Networks">
				</span>
				
				<h5 class="leftheading">&nbsp;Avenues (AVE) [Road-based]</h5>
				<p>The Avenues, or AVEs, are Road-based (not Avenue-based) override networks that include a landscaped median divider, much like the game's default 4-lane Avenue network.  Unlike the TLAs, the AVEs
				do not allow direct access to buildings and lots on the far side of the network.</p>
				
				<span class="leftcolumn">			
					<ul>
						<li>2-Lane Avenue (AVE-2) [Single Tile]</li>
						<li>6-Lane Avenue (AVE-6) [Triple Tile]</li>

					<img class="screenleft" src="images/nwm-ave-networks.jpg" alt="AVE Networks">
				</span>
				
				<h5 class="leftheading">&nbsp;Roads (RD) [Road-based]</h5>
				<p>The Roads, or RDs, are Road-based override networks that do not feature a median, similar to the game's default Road network in appearance, but with more lanes.  Unlike the TLAs, the RDs
				do not allow direct access to buildings and lots on the far side of the network.</p>

				<span class="leftcolumn">				
					<ul>
						<li>3-Lane Asymmetrical Road (ARD-3) [Single Tile]</li>
						<li>4-Lane Narrow Road (NRD-4) [Single Tile]</li>

				</span>
				
				<h5 class="leftheading">&nbsp;One-Way Roads (OWR) [One-Way Road-based]</h5>
				<p>The One-Way Roads, or OWRs, are One-Way Road-based override networks that, in contrast to the other networks in the NWM, only allow traffic in a single direction, but feature differing
				numbers of lanes compared to the game's default 2-lane One-Way Road setup.  Similar to the default One-Way Road network, directionality of each NWM OWR network is determined by draw direction, 
				and these width variants can have their direction reversed in the same way.  Due to the presence of crossover paths on the multi-tile variants, it is
				possible for vehicles to reach buildings and lots on the far side of the network.</p>

				<span class="leftcolumn">				
					<ul>
						<li>1-Lane One-Way Road (OWR-1) [Single Tile]</li>
						<li>3-Lane One-Way Road (OWR-3) [Single Tile]</li>

				<h4 class="leftheading"><a name="diagonals"></a>&nbsp;Constructing Diagonals and Curves</h4>
					<p>The diagonal functionality for the single-tile NWM networks is straightforward (and diagonal starters are provided for all single-tile networks, except the NRD-4), but dual and triple-tile 
					NWM networks may prove to be less intuitive at first, as there are different construction methods used, depending on the network.</p>
					<p>The RD-4 and OWR-4 operate on a "shared-tile" setup.  Here is how the base layout (without the overrides) 
					looks for a shared-tile setup:</p>
					
					<img class="screenshot" src="images/diag1.jpg" alt="diag1">
					
					<p>The TLA-5, OWR-5 and RD-6 operate on a "split tile" setup.  here is how the base layout (without the overrides) looks for a split-tile setup:</p>
					
					<img class="screenshot" src="images/diag2.jpg" alt="diag2">
					
					<p>The TLA-7 and AVE-6 operate on a slightly larger "split tile setup":</p>

				<div class="bannerfull"><a name="transition"></a><h4>&nbsp;Transitioning to Other Networks</h4></div>
				<div class="regtext">
					<p>There are three methods by which one can create a transition between an NWM network and another network: the <strong>Draggable Stub Method</strong>, the draggable <strong>Direct Connection Method</strong>, and
					the use of <strong>Puzzle Pieces</strong>.  Note that, except in the case of setups not otherwise covered, the Puzzle Piece method is largely considered deprecated/outdated, due to its
					lack of support for wealth-level textures.</p>
					
					<h5 class="leftheading">Draggable Stub Method</h5>
					<p>The Draggable Stub Method is used to transition between an override network and its base network (i.e. from ARD-3 to Road) or between two override networks sharing the same base network (i.e. from
					RD-4 to RD-6).  In order to create transitions that use this method, simply drag each network such that the end stubs of each network are right next to one another, as seen below on the left.  Provided the combination
					of networks is one that is supported, the stubs will convert into a transition between the networks, as seen on the right.  This method will also work for networks of different tile widths (i.e. TLA-3 to TLA-5)</p>
					
					<img class="screencenter" src="images/dragtrans1.jpg" alt="Draggable Stub Method">
					
					<h5 class="leftheading">Direct Connection Method</h5>
					<p>The Direct Connection Method is generally used to transition between an override network and a network (default or override) built from a different base (i.e. from TLA-5 to Avenue, or from TLA-3 to RHW-2).  In order to 
					create transitions that use this method, simply drag one network into the other, similar to the fashion shown below.  Provided the combination
					of networks is one that is supported, the direct connection will convert into a transition between the networks, as seen on the right.</p>
					
					<img class="screencenter" src="images/dragtrans2.jpg" alt="Direct Connection Method">
					
					<h5 class="leftheading">Puzzle Piece Method</h5>
					<p>The Puzzle Piece Method entails using the items found under the NWM Transition Puzzle Pieces button.  To create a transition, simply find the desired puzzle piece from the menu, aligning the preview
					to where one wishes to place it, and clicking to plop the piece.  Note that some of the puzzle-based transitions do not have NWM Starters on their ends, and the base network setup must be built <strong><em>before
					plopping the puzzle piece</em></strong>.</p>  
					<p><strong>Note</strong>: With the exception of some setups that are not supported any other way, the Puzzle Piece Method is deprecated/outdated.  
					All future additions to the repertoire of NWM transitions will be in draggable form, using either the Draggable Stub or Direct Connection Methods, as appropriate.  Draggable treatments for all of the existing 
					puzzle pieces are planned for a future NAM release.</p>
					
					<p>A full listing of supported draggable transitions can be found in the <a href="#capabilities">Network Capabilities</a> section.  A listing of the existing transition puzzle pieces can be found in the 
					<a href="#menu">Menu Items section.</p>
				</div>

								
				<div class="bannerfull"><a name="capacity"></a><h4>&nbsp;Capacities and Speeds</h4></div>
				<div class="regtext">
				</div>
				<p>The capacity of each network depends on the <a href="../traffic-sim/traffic-sim.html">Traffic Plugin</a> one has installed. Capacity is generally calculated on a per tile basis by the game.  
				All NWM networks are also surface street-type networks, meaning that they allow full access to RCI Zones. The capacities for the five standard capacity levels of the NAM Traffic Plugin are listed below.  
				Please note that these capacities listed are for the <em>full width</em> of the network, rather than the per-tile capacity.</p>  
				<p>With the exception of the OWR-1 and RD-4 networks, which share the same capacity as their respective base networks, all other NWM networks have a capacity that is 125% of that of the base network used 
				in the override network setup, as a result of using a special pathing setup that allows a one-time capacity boost of 25%.  This is why the NRD-4, despite having an additional lane, has the same capacity 
				as the other boosted single-tile networks, as well as why the OWR-1 has the same capacity as the base One-Way Road.  Since crossover paths on multi-tile override networks trigger the boost,
				the OWR-5 has the same capacity as the OWR-4, though the use of a split tile diagonals on the OWR-5 will give it a higher diagonal capacity than the OWR-4 and its shared tile diagonals.</p>

					<h5 class="leftheading">ADDITIONAL NOTES</h5>
						<p><strong>T-End Min</strong>: If the given network is to end at a T-intersection, this value is the minimum number of total lanes that needs to be on the cross network.  For instance, while
						an RD-6 (T-End Min = 3) can end at an ARD-3 (3 total thru lanes), it cannot end at a Road (2 total thru lanes).  Center lanes on TLA networks do not count toward the overall figure
						(i.e. the TLA-5 would be considered to have 4 lanes total in this instance).</p>
						<p><strong>T-In Max</strong>: If a cross network ends at the given network in a T-intersection, this value is the maximum number of lanes on the cross network heading inbound to the
						T-intersection (half the network, in the case of a two-way network, the full network if one-way).  For instance, an AVE-2 can have an Avenue or RD-4 end at it (AVE-2 T-In Max = 2, while
						the Avenue and RD-4 have 4 lanes total, 2 heading inbound to the intersection), but an OWR-1 cannot (T-In Max = 1).  Center lanes on TLA networks do not count toward the overall figure
						(i.e. the TLA-5 would be considered to have 4 lanes total in this instance).</p>
						<p><strong>OxO</strong>: OxO stands for "orthogonal x orthogonal", and refers to a situation where both networks are orthogonal (in a straight line) along the game's grid, intersecting perpendicularly 
						(at 90° angles at all corners)</p>
						<p><strong>OxD</strong>: OxD stands for "orthogonal x diagonal", and refers to a situation where the given network is orthogonal (in a straight line) along the game's grid, and the cross network is diagonal
						(running at a 45° angle).</p>
						<p><strong>DxO</strong>: DxO stands for "diagonal x orthogonal", and refers to a situation where the base network is diagonal (running at a 45° angle), and the cross network is orthogonal (in a straight line) 
						along the game's grid.</p>
						<p><strong>DxD</strong>: DxD stands for "diagonal x diagonal", and refers to a situation where both networks are diagonal (running at a 45° angle) along the game's grid, intersecting perpendicularly 
						(at 90° angles at all corners)</p>
						<p><strong>Stub</strong>: Indication that the transition can be built using the Draggable Stub Method.</p>
						<p><strong>Dir</strong>: Indication that the transition can be built using the Direct Connection Method.</p>
						<p><strong>PP</strong>: Indication that the feature can only be built through the use of a static Puzzle Piece.</p>

			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="neighbor"></a><h4>&nbsp;A Note Regarding Neighbor Connections</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>Neighbor connections are possible for all Road-based NWM networks, though the three Road-based multi-tile networks (TLA-5, RD-4, and RD-6) require either (a) conversion to Avenue before the 
				edge of the city tile, or (b) the use of special Neighbor Connector pieces in order to provide proper functionality.  Note that the Avenue conversion method is, at present, more reliable than
				the Neighbor Connector pieces, which still have some unexplained issues requiring further investigation (see <a href="#knownissues">the Known Issues section</a>).</p>
				<p>The TLA-7 and AVE-6 also have Neighbor Connector pieces, but can natively 
				create the connections, albeit with the caveat of crowding on the central tile of each network at the border, which also exists to an extent with the piece-based approach.</p>
				<p>In order to use the Neighbor Connector pieces, simply build the neighbor connection as normal by dragging the override to the edge of the city tile with the Road tool, then
				place the appropriate Neighbor Connector for the network over top of the neighbor connection arrows.  Note that the game's default 
				Neighbor Connection arrows will not change direction, nor do they need to in order for the connection to function with the connector pieces.</p>
				
				<img class="screenshot" src="images/nwmneighbor.jpg" alt="NWM Neighbor Connection">
				
				<p>With the single-tile Road-based networks, neighbor connections may be built normally by simply dragging the network to the edge of the tile, without any alteration.
				One-Way Road-based networks cannot create neighbor connections, much like their base network.  This can be worked around to an extent, however--see the <a href="#knownissues">Known Issues section</a>.</p>

			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="turnlanes"></a><h4>&nbsp;Turn Lanes and NWM Networks</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
			<p>The best way to add turn lanes to NWM networks is through the <a href="../turn-lanes/turn-lanes.html#ftl">FLEX Turn Lanes (FTLs)</a>.  The FTL system includes modular draggable/FLEX components, including
			some pre-fabricated setups, which can be plopped in a single click.  The following NWM networks are currently capable of interfacing with the FTL system:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>TLA-3: Type 110</li>
				<li>AVE-2: Type 110</li>
				<li>ARD-3: Type 110</li>
				<li>TLA-5: Type 120 and Type 220</li>
				<li>TLA-7: Type 130</li>
				<li>AVE-6: Type 130</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All NWM networks also support at least some capabilities with the FTL Slip Lanes as well (ARD-3 support, however, is limited, due to its complexity).  NWM-related features with the FTL system
			are planned to be expanded greatly with future updates.</p>
			<p>The NWM may also interface with the older Turn Lane Extension Pieces (TuLEPs), which have since become deprecated/outdated with the introduction of the FLEX Turn Lanes.  The NWM installs a set
			of Type 130 TuLEPs, designed for use with the NWM's triple-tile networks, the TLA-7 and AVE-6.  The contents of this are listed above in the <a href="#menu">menu section</a>.</p>
			<p>Support for the older Avenue and Road Turning Lanes does not exist with the NWM.  The NWM is actually part of the reason the Road Turning Lanes plugin was switched away from its old "automatic" construction method, to the 
			new "semi-automatic" approach.</p>

			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="knownissues"></a><h4>&nbsp;Known Issues</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>Below is a list of known issues with the Network Widening Mod plugin, that, at present, have not or <em>cannot</em> be addressed:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Crossover paths on the TLA networks, as well as the OWR-4 and OWR-5, may cause automata (vehicles) to behave strangely, including weaving or circular/wrong-way driving.  This is
					especially pronounced with Generated Automata (i.e. moving trucks, police cars, and other non-commute-related vehicles that spawn from nearby lots), as opposed to Commute Automata.  This is a limitation
					of the game's automata engine, and there is no known solution that does not break the otherwise very useful functionality of the networks, which the NAM Team prioritizes over simply visual effects,
					like automata behavior.</li>
					<li>The NWM Neighbor Connector Pieces, despite being set up identical to the perfectly functional RealHighway (RHW) Neighbor Connector Pieces, have had a tendency to not accept as much traffic
					as they should.  For dual-tile networks, simply switch to Avenue for the connection.  With triple-tile networks, the center tile will allow for a functional connection, though congestion is to be
					expected.  Further investigation on this issue is planned.</li>
					<li>Complex setups in which certain combinations of otherwise supported intersections/crossings and/or sharp curves are placed directly adjacent to one another, with no gap, may cause NWM network overrides to 
					destabilize.  This is due to a lack of override code to cover the adjacency situation, and is not necessarily a bug.  If you feel the particular adjacency situation is useful enough that it should be covered, 
					please stop by our <a href="#support-development">support threads</a> (see "Information on Support and Development Updates" below) with a screenshot of the particular setup, so we can make a determination and/or help you find an alternate solution that is 
					presently supported.</li>
					<li>The NWM's One-Way Road variants cannot form Neighbor Connections, mainly as the base One-Way Road network cannot form them, either.  There is a workaround if one installed the NAM's
					<a href="../realhighway/realhighway.html">RealHighway (RHW)</a> plugin, by transitioning their NWM OWRs to RHWs just before the edge of the city tile, and using the RHW's Neighbor Connector pieces.
					</li>
					<li>The NWM OWR networks do not have any traffic signals facing their approaches at intersections, due to the fact that the stop points that are necessary for signal functionality do
					not work by default on the base One-Way Road network.  This will be addressed in the future with an extension to the NAM's <a href="../turn-lanes/turn-lanes.html#sitap">Signalized Intersection and Turn Arrow 
					Project(SITAP).</li>
