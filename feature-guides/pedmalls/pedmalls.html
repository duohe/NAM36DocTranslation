			<div class="regtext">
				<p><strong>PedMall Tiles</strong>
				are essentially just like real Pedestrian Malls [though with some
				differences of course] &amp; even have a Y.I.M.B.Y impact on immediate
				surroundings, reducing pollution &amp; boosting desirability. PedMall
				Tiles allows for Commercial and Industrial development to
				occur/sustain, while only allowing Sims to use the PedMall Tiles to
				Walk on. In other words; no other form of transport is possible on PedMall Tiles, 
				other than walking.</p>	

				<p>PedMall Tiles can <strong>NOT</strong>
				be used as a replacement for Street/Road/OneWayRoad/Avenue access for
				direct access to Residential Zones. Sims can however access PedMall
				Tiles directly from their homes (from their backyard for example), just
				<strong>not</strong> in front of their Residential Zoning Arrow. Residential zones must still have Street/Road/OneWayRoad/Avenue (with &#8216;<strong>Car</strong>&#8217;
				access) at the front of their zoning arrow in order to develop - This
				particular characteristic is effectively controlled by the games&#8217; EXE
				&amp; can not be changed. Also; if Sims do not use the PedMall Tiles
				[i.e. no usage], &amp;/or buildings lining PedMall Tiles do not have
				any commuters, then it will have to do with the set-up &amp; how
				they&#8217;re being used &amp;/or other factors. The PedMall Tiles work just
				fine, &amp; carry Pedestrians just fine. If in doubt, please experiment.</p>
				
				<p>Using PedMall Tiles &#8216;in place of&#8217; Street/Road/OneWayRoad/Avenue where there
				exist highly busy commercial areas may have an impact on the Customer rating [low/medium/high].</p>
				
				<p>In addition to the paved PedMall tiles, there are also a series of Ped Overpass puzzle pieces, for crossing Maxis base networks and some older NAM override networks (such as GLR), plus
				a set of Mountain Trail pieces, which work similarly to the PedMalls, but have a more rural appearance.</p>
				
				<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>As a result of pathing changes made as part of the NAM 33 release of November 2015, PedMall Tiles no longer require a Mass Transit station to initiate access.  The PedMalls can 
				accept traffic simply by being placed adjacent to an orthogonal stretch of any base network found under the Roads menu, plus Network Widening Mod override networks and FLEX Turn Lanes, 
				as well as some Dual-Networking items</p>
