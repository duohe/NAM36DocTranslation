				<p>To trigger the initial Road roundabout, you must draw a Road circle in a 2x2 tile area using the Road network tool. 
				There currently exist many variations with one, two, three or four orthogonal or diagonal Roads stemming from this initial 2x2 tile area. </p>
				<p>The Street-based version is constructed identically, by drawing a Street circle in a 2x2 area using the Street network tool.</p>

			<div class="regtext">
				<p>To trigger the initial One-Way Road roundabout, you must draw a One-Way Road circle in a 3x3 tile area. The One-Way Road Roundabouts are the most full-featured of all the types,
				capable of accepting six (6) different approaches, and can even accept the RHW-2 and MIS Ramp networks from the <a href="../realhighway/realhighway.html">RealHighway</a> plugin.</p>
				
				<p>Note that the circle must be drawn <em>counter-clockwise</em> if one's game has traffic driving on the right (RHD), and <em>clockwise</em> if one's game has traffic driving on the left (LHD).</p>

			<div class="regtext">
				<p>Avenue roundabouts are 4x4 FLEX pieces, which can be found under the Avenue Roundabouts and Interchanges button. After placing down one of these FLEX pieces, you can drag orthogonal and diagonal Avenues into the roundabout in order to connect it with the rest of your network. 
				By default, the Avenue roundabout comes with FLUP support--the FLUPs portal aligns parallel to the fountain prop at the center of the roundabout. If this functionality is not required, you can bulldoze 
				the inner 2x2 tile fountain prop after building the roundabout and replace it by any other items. There are also a few Avenue roundabout variations including crossings with Elevated Highway and GLR.</p>
				
				<p>The Avenue roundabouts can accept up to eight (8) Avenue approaches.</p>

				<p>Note that the same button also contains the Avenue Y-Stack interchange and turbo roundabouts.</p>

			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="turbo"></a><h4>&nbsp;Advanced/Turbo Roundabouts</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>Turbo roundabouts are static puzzle pieces that can be found under the Avenue Roundabouts and Interchanges button and serve as circular intersections between a double-tile and a single-tile network, 
				such as Avenue/RD-4/RD-6 and ARD-3/TuLEPs/FTLs. In order to make sure they can be properly connected to your network, 
				it is advisable to bulldoze a 2x1 tile intersection between two suitable networks and plop the turbo roundabout onto the resulting gap. </p>
