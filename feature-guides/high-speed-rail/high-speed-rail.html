				<p>The High Speed Rail Project (HSRP) adds two new &ldquo;model variations&rdquo; to the network systems. A models variation is a new set of models for a network in this case for Monorail. 
				In the early years of SC4, new technology was found by Smoncrie which allowed us to use a single puzzle piece to create a starter for a new set of textures or models for the same network, 
				there are already a few mods that take advantage of this technology, namely draggable GLR, SAM, and RHW. At the moment, there are two new model variations included in this mod, HSR, elevated, and GHSR, 
				a ground version.</p>
				
				<p>The original HSRP replaced Monorail.  At the time this was the best way of implementation, and was created by 3ddz, founded by Murakamon, on the 24th of February 2006.  Since then there 
				has only been one release, HSRP Beta 1. This mod uses the original models from that release for HSR, and a lowered version for GHSR. No other modifications were made to the models.</p>
				
				<p><em>NOTE: The High Speed Rail Project, in its current form, is no longer in active development.  Plans for future HSR-type functionality are still being determined as of NAM Version 36.</em></p>

			<div class="regtext">
				<p>To install the High Speed Rail Project via Custom Installation, under the "NAM Networks and Network Expansions" section, simply select the "High Speed Rail Project" option.  This box is automatically selected
				if one chooses the "Networks and Traffic Simulator" or "Complete Installation" options.</p>
				
				<img class="screenshot" src="images/hsr-installer1.jpg" alt="HSR Installation">		
				
				<p>The High Speed Rail Project also includes a custom darker texture option, made by <strong>vershner</strong>.  This option can be selected under the "Additional Features and Customizations" section.</p>

			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="networks"></a><h4>&nbsp;HSR Override Networks</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
			
				<p>The High Speed Rail Project includes a total of two Monorail-based draggable override networks: the (Elevated) High Speed Rail network (HSR), which consists of an elevated track at a height of 15.5 meters (functionally equivalent
				to "Level 2" in NAM elevation nomenclature), and the Ground High Speed Rail network (GHSR), which sits essentially at ground level, at 1 meter elevation.</p>
				
				<img class="screenshot" src="images/hsr-networks.jpg" alt="HSR Networks">		
				
				<p>To build an HSR override network, first place the appropriate starter piece from the menu, then select the Monorail network tool, and drag Monorail through the starter.  The stretch of Monorail should
				convert to the appropriate HSR network at that point.</p>
				
				<a href="images/hsr-starter.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/hsr-starter.jpg" alt="HSR Starter Usage"></a>
				
				<p>Curves to diagonals can also be accomplished through simple dragging motions, as with any other draggable network.  HSR has been designed to have a slightly wider radius for its default curve, which
				should be taken into consideration when building over/underpasses near curves.</p>
				
				<a href="images/hsr-diagonal.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/hsr-diagonal.jpg" alt="HSR Diagonal Usage"></a>
				
				<p>Supported draggable crossing setups can be built much in the same way that Monorail crossings are, by simply dragging the HSR tracks over (or under) the desired network as appropriate.  Due to game limitations,
				the crossing will initially show as a Monorail crossing in the preview, but provided the setup is supported, it will change to the appropriate HSR override network.  HSR networks 
				cannot cross other networks at the same height level, as grade separation is key to allowing the trains to operate at high speeds.  Both HSR and GHSR, however, can cross over or under an L1 elevated network,
				such as the L1 RealHighway shown below.</p>  
				
				<a href="images/hsr-crossing.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/hsr-crossing.jpg" alt="HSR Crossing"></a>
				
				<a href="images/ghsr-crossing.jpg"><img class="screencenter" src="images/ghsr-crossing.jpg" alt="GHSR Crossing"></a>

				
				<p>If a crossing reverts back to the base Monorail network, or results in a "blank spot" in the network, it is a sign that the particular setup is not supported by the plugin.  Refer to the <a href="#capabilities">
				Network Capabilities</a> section of this document for guidance.  Note that some setups  not possible through draggable means can be constructed through the use of static puzzle pieces 
				(see <a href="#menu">List of Menu Items</a> below.</p>	
			</div>
			
			<div class="bannerfull"><a name="capacities"></a><h4>&nbsp;Capacities and Speeds</h4></div>
			<div class="regtext">
				<p>The capacity and speed of both the Elevated and Ground High Speed Rail override networks is identical to that of the base Monorail network.  The precise capacity 
				depends on the <a href="../traffic-sim/traffic-sim.html">Traffic Plugin</a> one has installed. Capacity is generally calculated on a per tile basis by the game.</p>

			<div class="regtext">
				<p>As the High Speed Rail Project's override networks are Monorail-based, Monorail automata will appear on HSR tracks by default.  If one wishes to change the appearance of the HSR trains,
				are several third-party HSRP automata skins available (which probably look nice on your Monorail tracks as well).  One such set is the <a href="http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=2975">VDK Train Mods Vol 7</a>

				<p>The High Speed Rail Project supports several different types of bridges, for both the elevated HSR network and GHSR.  To build the bridges, 
				simply drag the Monorail network across the body of water (or sufficiently deep canyon), and options for HSR bridges will appear.</p>
